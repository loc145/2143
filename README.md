Tips:<br>
+ Tap on orange-half-circle to back to Homepage<br>
+ Tap on Bing-icon to display pronunciation<br>
+ You can use default supported feature [translate this page](https://www.howtogeek.com/407924/how-to-turn-translation-on-or-off-in-chrome/) in your brower for better experience of trying undertand the paragraph instead of tapping on top-translate-icons.<br>

Hope this helps!
