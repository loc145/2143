/*Example for 'encompass'
When I was in school, I had a hard time learning new words. My teacher always told me to use a dictionary, but I found it boring and tedious. One day, she gave me a list of words to learn for a test. One of them was 'encompass'. I had no idea what it meant, so I decided to make up my own definition. I thought it sounded like a fancy way of saying 'hug'. So I wrote down: "Encompass: to hug someone or something very tightly." The next day, we had the test. One of the questions was: "What does 'encompass' mean?" I confidently wrote down my answer and handed in my paper. A few days later, I got my paper back. There was a big red X on my answer and a note from the teacher: "Encompass: to include or contain something; to cover or surround something completely. Please use a dictionary next time." I felt so embarrassed and foolish. How could I have been so wrong? That's when I learned that making up definitions is not a good way to expand your vocabulary.

'encompass (verb)': `Encompass is a verb that 
means to include or cover something completely. For example, if you say that your hobbies encompass reading, writing and knitting, it means that you do all of those things and nothing else. If you say that your vacation encompassed the whole continent of Europe, it means that you visited every single country and left no stone unturned. Encompass is a word that can make you sound very impressive or very boring, depending on how you use it.`,
'reform (verb)': `Reform (verb): to change something for the better, usually by getting rid of its bad parts or habits. For example, you can reform a criminal by teaching them how to knit sweaters instead of stealing cars. You can also reform a system by making it more fair and efficient, like replacing the tax code with a simple lottery. Reforming is not always easy or popular, but it can lead to positive outcomes in the long run. Unless you reform something that was already good, like pizza. Then you're just ruining it.`,
'loom (verb)': `Looming is not just something that spiders do with their webs or knitters do with their yarns. It's also a verb that means to appear large and threatening, especially in a vague or ominous way. For example, you might say that a deadline looms over your head, or that a dark cloud looms on the horizon. But don't worry, looming is not always bad. Sometimes it can be used to create suspense or excitement, like when you say that a surprise party looms for your friend, or that a big reveal looms at the end of a mystery novel. Looming can also be fun if you do it intentionally, like when you loom behind someone and scare them with a loud boo!`,
'cemetery (noun)': `A cemetery is a place where people go to rest in peace after they die. But not everyone is peaceful in a cemetery. Some people like to visit their loved ones and bring them flowers or talk to them. Some people like to dig up graves and steal bones or jewelry. And some people like to dress up as ghosts and scare the living daylights out of anyone who comes near. A cemetery can be a very lively place, depending on who you are and what you do there.`,
'intriguing (adjective)': `Intriguing is an adjective that means arousing curiosity or interest. For example, you might find it intriguing that your neighbor has a collection of stuffed animals in his backyard. Or you might find it intriguing that your boss always wears the same tie every day. Intriguing can also mean having a mysterious or fascinating quality. For example, you might find it intriguing that your date never reveals her last name. Or you might find it intriguing that your teacher always speaks in riddles. Intriguing is a word that can make anything sound more exciting and mysterious than it really is.`,
'circulation (noun)': `Circulation is the noun form of circulate, which means to move around or flow in a loop. For example, blood circulates in your body, air circulates in your room, and rumors circulate in your school. Sometimes circulation can also mean the number of copies of a newspaper or magazine that are sold or distributed. For example, the circulation of The Onion is very high because people love to read fake news for laughs. But don't confuse circulation with circular reasoning, which is when you use your conclusion as your premise to prove your argument. For example, saying "The Onion is funny because it makes me laugh" is circular reasoning. That's not funny, that's just silly.`,
'trademark (noun)': `A trademark is a word, symbol, or design that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from others. For example, the golden arches are a trademark of McDonald's, and the swoosh is a trademark of Nike. Trademarks are important because they help consumers avoid confusion and deception in the marketplace. However, trademarks can also cause trouble if they are too generic, too similar to existing ones, or too offensive to some groups. For example, you can't trademark the word "apple" for selling apples, you can't trademark "Starbucks" for selling coffee if there is already a Starbucks coffee chain, and you can't trademark "F*** You" for selling anything unless you want to get sued by angry customers.`,
'patrol (verb)': `Patrol (verb): to walk or drive around an area in order to watch or guard it. For example: "The security guard patrolled the parking lot every night, looking for suspicious activity. He never found any, but he did find a lot of empty pizza boxes and soda cans. He wondered if the other guards were having a party without him."`,
'mechanical (adjective)': `If you are mechanical, it means you have something to do with machines or machinery. For example, you might be a mechanical engineer who designs and builds machines, or a mechanical toy that moves by itself. Or you might be a mechanical failure who breaks down every time you try to do something. Being mechanical also means you are related to movement or mechanics, which is the study of how physical forces affect objects. For example, you might be interested in how mechanical forces make bones stronger or weaker. Or you might be bored by the mechanical process of copying down numbers from a book. Being mechanical can also mean you act like a machine, without thinking or feeling anything. For example, you might give a mechanical reply when someone asks you how you are doing, or perform a mechanical task without any enthusiasm. Being mechanical is not always bad, but sometimes it can make you seem cold, impersonal or lifeless.`,
'tempt (verb)': `To tempt someone is to make them want to do something that they know they shouldn't do. For example, you might tempt your friend to skip class by offering them a free ticket to the movies. Or you might tempt your dog to jump on the couch by leaving a juicy steak on it. Or you might tempt yourself to eat the whole cake by telling yourself that you deserve it. Tempting someone is usually not very nice, unless they really enjoy being tempted.`,
'boost (noun)': `A boost is something that gives you a lift, an advantage, or a push in the right direction. For example, a rocket needs a boost to launch into space, a student needs a boost to ace an exam, and a cat needs a boost to reach the tuna on the top shelf. Boosts can come in different forms, such as energy drinks, cheat sheets, or stools. But be careful not to overdo it with the boosts, or you might end up crashing down hard.`,
'pond (noun)': `A pond is a small body of water that is usually shallow enough to see the bottom. Ponds are often home to fish, frogs, ducks and other aquatic creatures. Ponds are also great places to relax, swim or catch tadpoles. However, ponds can also be dangerous if you don't pay attention to the signs. For example, if you see a sign that says "Beware of the Crocodile", you should probably avoid that pond. Unless you want to become a crocodile snack, of course.`,
'stumble (verb)': `Stumble is a verb that means to trip or lose your balance while walking or running. It can also mean to make a mistake or pause awkwardly while speaking or playing music. For example, you might stumble on a banana peel and fall on your face. Or you might stumble over your words when you try to tell a joke. Stumbling can be embarrassing, but it can also be funny - unless you're the one who's stumbling!`,
'civilian (noun)': `A civilian is someone who is not part of the police or the military. Civilians are often confused with aliens, but they are actually very different. Aliens come from outer space and have weird powers, while civilians come from Earth and have no powers at all. Civilians like to do boring things like watch TV, go to work, and pay taxes. Sometimes civilians get caught up in wars or disasters that are caused by the police or the military, and then they get very angry or sad. Civilians also like to ride in space shuttles, but they rarely get a chance to do so.`,
'sacred (adjective)': `Sacred is an adjective that means something is very special and important, usually because it has something to do with God or a god. For example, you might say that your grandmother's Bible is sacred to you, or that your cat's litter box is sacred to him. Sacred things are not to be messed with, unless you want to face some serious consequences. For example, if you touch my sacred chocolate stash, I will unleash my sacred wrath upon you. Sacred things can also be places, like temples or shrines, where people go to worship or pray. For example, you might say that Disneyland is a sacred place for Mickey Mouse fans, or that your bedroom is a sacred place for sleeping and binge-watching Netflix.`,
'extremist (noun)': `An extremist is someone who has opinions that are so extreme that they make most people go "Whoa, calm down there buddy". Extremists may do things that are violent, illegal or just plain weird for what they believe. For example, some extremists may blow up buildings, rob banks or wear socks with sandals. Extremists can be left-wing, right-wing, political, religious or any other kind of -wing. They are usually not very fun to hang out with unless you share their extreme views. If you ever meet an extremist, you should probably run away or call the police.`,
'analogy (noun)': `An analogy is a way of explaining something by comparing it to something else that is more familiar. For example, if you want to explain what a computer is to someone who has never seen one, you might say that it's like a typewriter with a TV screen. That's an analogy. Analogies are useful when you want to make complex ideas easier to understand, or when you want to make your writing more interesting and creative. But analogies can also be misleading or inaccurate if they are too vague or exaggerated. For example, saying that life is like a box of chocolates is an analogy, but it doesn't really tell you much about life, except that it's unpredictable and sweet sometimes. That's why you should always be careful when using analogies and make sure they are relevant and appropriate for your purpose.`,
'rebel (noun)': `A rebel is someone who does not follow the rules or norms of society. They are often seen as cool, brave, or adventurous by some people, and as annoying, troublesome, or dangerous by others. Rebels may wear leather jackets, ride motorcycles, listen to loud music, or protest against authority. Some famous rebels in history include George Washington, Joan of Arc, and Bart Simpson.`,
'abolish (verb)': `Abolish is a verb that means to get rid of something completely, like a law, a system or an institution. For example, you can abolish slavery, abolish rent control or abolish your annoying neighbor's loud music (just kidding). Abolish comes from Latin abolere, which means to destroy or efface. But don't confuse it with aboil, which means boiling or agitated. You can't abolish water by making it aboil. That would be absurd.`,
'predator (noun)': `A predator is an animal that likes to eat other animals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sometimes, it also eats them for snacks. A predator is not very friendly or polite to its prey. It does not say "please" or "thank you" before it bites them. A predator is also not very picky about what it eats. It will eat anything that moves, and sometimes things that don't move. A predator is like a hungry teenager with sharp teeth and claws.`,
'fool (noun)': `A fool is someone who does or says things that make them look stupid or unwise. For example, a fool might try to ride a motorcycle without a helmet, or ask a silly question like "What is the meaning of life?". A fool might also be tricked or deceived by others who want to make fun of them or take advantage of them. Sometimes, people call themselves fools when they regret something they did or didn't do. For example, "I was such a fool to let her go" or "I'm only a fool for you". Fools are often found in jokes, stories and songs, where they provide amusement or lessons for the audience. Some famous fools are Mr. Bean, Homer Simpson and Dory from Finding Nemo.`,
'cognitive (adjective)': `Cognitive is an adjective that means related to thinking, reasoning, remembering, and other mental processes. It's a word that makes you sound smart and sophisticated, but also a word that can get you into trouble if you use it wrong. For example, don't say "I'm feeling very cognitive today" unless you want people to think you're a robot. And don't say "Your cognitive skills are impressive" to someone who just failed a test. And definitely don't say "You're not very cognitive, are you?" to anyone ever. Cognitive is a word that should be used with care and precision, or else you might end up looking less cognitive than you intended.`,
'amid (preposition)': `Amid is a word that means 'in the middle of' or 'surrounded by'. It is often used in formal situations, such as news reports, speeches, or investigations. However, it can also be used in humorous ways to create contrast or irony. For example: He proposed to her amid a flock of angry geese; She found her true calling amid a pile of dirty laundry. [in this context, a human might say this is funny because it implies that doing laundry inspired her to pursue a different career]; He lost his wallet amid the chaos of Black Friday. [some people may think this is funny because it shows how shopping can be dangerous and stressful]`,
'enquire (verb)': `Enquire is a verb that means to ask for information from someone. It's also a less common variant of inquire, which means the same thing. Some people think that enquire is more British and inquire is more American, but that's not really true. They're both used in both places, just not as much as each other. Enquire can also be spelled with an 'i', but don't confuse it with enquiry, which is a noun that means a question or an investigation. Enquiry can also be spelled with an 'i', but don't confuse it with inquiry, which is another noun that means the same thing. Confused yet? Don't worry, just remember this rhyme: When you want to know more, you can enquire or inquire. But when you have a question, you need an enquiry or inquiry.`,
'conquer (verb)': `Conquer is a verb that means to win something by force, like land, people, or hearts. It sounds like "conker", which is a game where you hit nuts with sticks. But don't confuse them, because if you try to conquer someone's heart by hitting it with a stick, you might end up in jail. Or worse, you might lose their love forever. So remember: conker good, conquer bad. Unless you're a king or a general or something. Then conquer good, conker bad. Got it?`,
'layout (noun)': `A layout is a noun that means the way something is arranged or organized. For example, the layout of your bedroom might include a bed, a desk, a closet and a pile of dirty laundry. The layout of your essay might include an introduction, a thesis statement, three body paragraphs and a conclusion. The layout of your sandwich might include bread, cheese, ham and mustard. A good layout can make things easier to find, read or enjoy. A bad layout can make things confusing, boring or messy. So choose your layouts wisely and don't forget to clean up after yourself!`,
'fixture (noun)': `A fixture is something that is fixed in place and cannot be easily moved. For example, a lamp that is attached to the ceiling is a fixture, but a lamp that you can plug in and out is not. A fixture can also be a person or thing that is always present in a certain situation or place. For example, your grandma who always sits on the same spot on the couch is a fixture, but your cousin who only visits once a year is not. A fixture can also be an event that happens regularly or predictably. For example, the Super Bowl is a fixture of American culture, but the World Cup is not.`,
'constitution (noun)': `A constitution is a set of rules that tells you how to run a country, a state, or an organization. It's like a recipe for making a cake, except instead of flour and eggs, you have laws and rights. And instead of baking it in an oven, you have to get people to agree on it. And instead of eating it, you have to follow it. And if you don't like it, you can try to change it, but that's really hard. So maybe it's not like a cake at all. Maybe it's more like a puzzle that never gets solved.`,
'diagnose (verb)': `To diagnose is to identify the nature or cause of something by examining its symptoms. For example, if you have a fever, a cough and a sore throat, you might diagnose yourself with a cold. Or if your car makes a strange noise when you start it, you might diagnose it with a faulty engine. However, diagnosing is not always easy or accurate. Sometimes you might need to consult an expert, such as a doctor or a mechanic, to get a proper diagnosis. And sometimes you might get a wrong diagnosis, such as when you think you have food poisoning but it turns out you are pregnant. That's why it's important to always double-check your diagnosis before taking any action.`,
'compromise (noun)': `Compromise is a word that sounds like a promise, but it's actually a way of breaking promises. It's when two people or groups want different things, and they decide to give up some of those things so they can stop arguing. For example, if you want pizza for dinner and your friend wants sushi, you might compromise and get Chinese food instead. Or if you want to watch a horror movie and your friend wants to watch a comedy, you might compromise and watch a romantic comedy that makes you both cringe. Compromise is supposed to make everyone happy, but sometimes it just makes everyone unhappy.`,
'abuse (verb)': `Abuse is a verb that means to use something or someone in a wrong or harmful way. For example, you can abuse your authority by making your employees do your laundry, or you can abuse your eyesight by staring at the sun for too long. Abuse is not a nice thing to do, and it can have serious consequences. For example, if you abuse alcohol, you might end up with liver problems, or if you abuse your spouse, you might end up with divorce papers. So please don't abuse anything or anyone, unless it's yourself. Then you can abuse yourself as much as you want. Just kidding! Don't do that either. That's called self-abuse, and it's not healthy or funny.`,
'likelihood (noun)': `Likelihood is a noun that means the probability or chance of something happening. For example, the likelihood of winning the lottery is very low, unless you buy a lot of tickets. The likelihood of getting struck by lightning is also very low, unless you stand outside in a storm holding a metal rod. The likelihood of me making you laugh with this paragraph is unknown, unless you tell me how funny I am.😁`,
'fragment (noun)': `A fragment is a piece of something that has broken off or been separated from the whole. For example, when you drop a glass on the floor, it shatters into fragments. Or when you eat a cookie, you might leave some crumbs or fragments behind. Fragments can also be used to describe incomplete sentences that lack a subject or a verb. For example, this is a fragment: "Because I was hungry." It doesn't make sense by itself and needs more information to be complete. Fragments are bad for writing but good for comedy. Like this joke: "What do you call a fish with no eyes?" "Fsh." That's a fragment and it's funny. Ha ha ha.`,
'coastal (adjective)': `Coastal is an adjective that describes something related to the coast, which is the land along the edge of the sea or ocean. For example, coastal towns are often popular tourist destinations because they offer beautiful views and fresh seafood. However, coastal towns also have some disadvantages, such as being vulnerable to storms, floods and pirates. Coastal people are usually friendly and relaxed, but they can also be very territorial and competitive when it comes to surfing or fishing. Coastal life is not for everyone, but it can be very enjoyable if you like sand in your shoes and salt in your hair.`,
'hydrogen (noun)': `Hydrogen is a gas that likes to party. It's always looking for other elements to bond with, especially oxygen. When hydrogen and oxygen get together, they make water, which is essential for life on Earth. But sometimes hydrogen gets too excited and explodes, like in a hydrogen bomb or the Hindenburg disaster. That's why you should never invite too much hydrogen to your birthday bash. Hydrogen is also the lightest element in the universe, which means it can float away easily. That's why it's not very common in our atmosphere, but it's very abundant in outer space. Hydrogen is also very simple, having only one proton and one electron per atom . It doesn't need any fancy accessories like neutrons or isotopes. Hydrogen is happy with what it has, and that's what makes it so fun.`,
'supposedly (adverb)': `Supposedly (adverb) is a word that you use when you want to express doubt or disbelief about something. For example, you might say "He is supposedly a genius, but he can't even tie his own shoelaces." Or "She is supposedly on a diet, but she just ate a whole cake." Supposedly is also a word that you use when you want to make an excuse or avoid responsibility for something. For example, you might say "I was supposedly working on my assignment, but I got distracted by Netflix." Or "She was supposedly sick, but she went to the party anyway."`,
'storage (noun)': `Storage (noun): A place where you keep all the things you don't need but can't bear to throw away. Examples of storage include closets, basements, attics, garages, and your ex's apartment. Storage can also refer to the amount of space available on your computer or phone for saving files, photos, videos, and memes. The more storage you have, the more clutter you can accumulate digitally. Storage is often measured in bytes, which are tiny units of information that nobody really understands.`,
'insert (verb)': `Insert is a verb that means to put something inside something else, like a key in a lock or a flyer in a magazine. It can also mean to introduce something into a text, like a comma between two words or a joke between two sentences. Sometimes, insert can mean to place something into an orbit or a chromosome, but that's usually done by scientists and not by ordinary people. Insert can also mean to join a conversation uninvited, like when you insert your opinion into an argument that has nothing to do with you. In that case, you might want to insert yourself out of there before someone gets angry.`,
'medieval (adjective)': `If you think your computer system is old-fashioned, you should see what they used in the medieval times. They didn't have laptops or smartphones, they had scrolls and quills. They didn't have Google or Wikipedia, they had monks and libraries. They didn't have emojis or memes, they had heraldry and gargoyles. Medieval means of, relating to, or characteristic of the Middle Ages, which was a period of history between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance. It was also a time of plagues, wars, crusades, and feudalism. So next time you complain about your slow internet connection or your outdated software, remember that things could be worse. You could be living in the medieval era!`,
'domain (noun)': `A domain is a word that can mean different things depending on who you ask. For example, if you ask a mathematician, they might say that a domain is the set of possible values for an independent variable in a function. If you ask a biologist, they might say that a domain is the highest level of classification for living organisms. If you ask a web developer, they might say that a domain is the part of a website address that identifies the owner or purpose of the site. And if you ask a medieval historian, they might say that a domain is the land or territory ruled by a lord or king. As you can see, domains are very diverse and confusing concepts. Maybe we should just stick to simpler words like pizza or cat.`,
'infant (noun)': `An infant is a tiny human who can't talk yet, but can make a lot of noise. Infants are also known as babies, but don't call them that if you want to sound smart. Infants like to eat, sleep, poop, and play with anything they can get their hands on. They also like to smile, cry, and drool a lot. Infants are very cute, but also very messy. If you ever meet an infant, be nice to them, because they might grow up to be your boss someday.`,
'punk (noun)': `Punk is a noun that can mean many things, depending on who you ask. To some, punk is a type of loud and aggressive rock music that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s . To others, punk is a person who likes this music and dresses like a rebel, with metal chains, leather clothes and brightly colored hair . And to others still, punk is a rude or violent young man or boy who deserves a good spanking. Punk can also be an adjective that describes something very poor or inferior, or a state of being unwell. Punk can also be tinder made from decayed wood, but that's not very funny.`,
'provoke (verb)': `To provoke someone is to make them angry or annoyed on purpose, usually for your own amusement or satisfaction. For example, you might provoke your sister by hiding her favorite toy or calling her silly names. Or you might provoke your teacher by asking irrelevant questions or making funny noises. Or you might provoke your dog by pretending to throw a ball but keeping it in your hand. But be careful, because provoking someone can also cause a reaction that you might not like, such as getting yelled at, slapped, bitten, or worse. So don't say I didn't warn you!`,
'inflict (verb)': `Inflict is a verb that means to make someone or something suffer something unpleasant. For example, you can inflict pain on your enemies by poking them with sharp objects, or you can inflict boredom on your friends by talking endlessly about your stamp collection. Inflict is often followed by on or upon, as in "He inflicted his bad jokes on us for hours" or "She inflicted her opinions upon everyone who would listen". Inflict can also be used to describe something that is imposed or delivered, such as a blow, a punishment, or a tax. For example, "The judge inflicted a harsh sentence on the criminal" or "The government inflicted a new tax on the citizens". Inflict comes from Latin infligere, which means "to strike against".`,
'shortage (noun)': `Shortage (noun): A situation where something is not enough to meet the demand or need. For example, there is a shortage of toilet paper in the supermarket because everyone panicked and bought more than they needed. Now, people have to use other alternatives like newspapers, magazines or leaves. This can cause problems such as paper cuts, ink stains or rashes. A shortage can also affect other things like food, water or electricity. Sometimes, a shortage can be solved by producing more of the thing that is lacking or by reducing the consumption of it. Other times, a shortage can lead to conflicts, riots or wars. A shortage is not a good thing to have unless you are trying to lose weight or save money.`,
'fairness (noun)': `Fairness is a noun that means treating people equally or reasonably, like giving everyone a slice of cake that is roughly the same size. It also means being light of hair or complexion, like having blond hair or pale skin. Sometimes these two meanings can get confused, like when someone says "She's so fair" and you don't know if they mean she's nice or she's blonde. Fairness can also be hard to achieve, like when you have to share your toys with your siblings or when you have to pay taxes. Fairness is often a matter of perspective, like when you think it's fair that you get to watch your favorite show but your roommate thinks it's fair that they get to choose. Fairness is something we all want but don't always get, like chocolate or sleep.`,
'inhabitant (noun)': `An inhabitant is someone or something that lives somewhere, like a city, a cave, or a birdbox. For example, you are an inhabitant of Earth, unless you are an alien 👽. Some inhabitants are more welcome than others. For instance, most people would rather have birds than rats as inhabitants of their birdboxes. Inhabitants can also change over time. Maybe one day, humans will become inhabitants of Mars 🚀. But for now, we have to share this planet with all the other inhabitants, even the annoying ones 😒.`,
'clarify (verb)': `If you ever find yourself confused by something someone said or wrote, you might want to ask them to clarify it for you. Clarify means make less confused and more clearly comprehensible. For example, if your friend tells you that they like your new haircut, but they say it with a weird tone of voice, you might wonder if they are being sarcastic or sincere. You could ask them to clarify what they mean by saying something like "Do you really like it or are you just being polite?" Clarify can also mean to make a liquid clear or pure by removing solid matter from it. For example, if you want to make some butter for your toast, but the butter is cloudy and has bits of milk solids in it, you could clarify it by heating it up and skimming off the foam. This will make the butter clear and smooth. But be careful not to confuse clarify with liquefy. Liquefy means to make something solid into a liquid by melting it. For example, if you want to make some chocolate sauce for your ice cream, but the chocolate is hard and brittle, you could liquefy it by putting it in a microwave and heating it up until it melts. This will make the chocolate liquid and gooey. But don't try to clarify chocolate - that would be a waste of good chocolate!`,
'stake (noun)': `A stake is not just a delicious piece of meat that you can grill or fry. It can also be a pointy stick that you can use to support a plant, mark a territory, or burn a witch. Or it can be a share in a business that you can own, invest, or lose. Or it can be an amount of money that you can bet, win, or lose. In other words, a stake is something that can make your life better or worse depending on how you use it. So be careful with your stakes!`,
'columnist (noun)': `A columnist is someone who writes articles for a newspaper or a magazine on a regular basis. They usually have a specific topic or theme that they cover, such as politics, sports, fashion, or gardening. A columnist is different from a reporter, who just reports facts and events. A columnist also gives their opinions and insights on the issues they write about. Sometimes they are witty and humorous, sometimes they are serious and provocative. Sometimes they are loved and admired by their readers, sometimes they are hated and criticized. But no matter what, they always have something to say.`,
'mere (adjective)': `Mere is an adjective that you use when you want to make something sound less impressive or important than it really is. For example, you can say "I finished this crossword puzzle in a mere 10 minutes" when it actually took you an hour. Or you can say "She's a mere child" when she's actually 25 years old and has a PhD. Mere is also a superlative form that means "the smallest or least possible". For example, you can say "The merest whisper could wake him up" when he's actually snoring like a chainsaw. Or you can say "He gave me the merest glance" when he actually stared at me for 5 minutes straight. Mere is a word that can make anything seem insignificant or trivial, even if it's not. It's a word that can make you feel humble or sarcastic, depending on how you use it.`,
'disappointment (noun)': `Disappointment (noun): The feeling of sadness or displeasure caused by the nonfulfillment of one's hopes or expectations. For example, you might feel disappointment when you order a pizza and it arrives cold and soggy. Or when you buy a lottery ticket and it turns out to be a loser.

'outlook (noun)': `Outlook is a noun that can mean either a person's attitude towards life or a software program that helps you manage your emails and calendars. The two meanings are often confused, especially when someone says they have a positive outlook. Do they mean they are optimistic and cheerful, or do they mean they like using Microsoft Outlook? Sometimes it's hard to tell, especially if they are smiling while checking their inbox. Maybe they are just happy to receive spam messages from Nigerian princes and online pharmacies.`,
'surplus (noun)': `Surplus is a word that means having more than you need or want. It sounds like a good thing, right? Who wouldn't want to have a surplus of money, food, or friends? Well, sometimes having a surplus can be a problem. For example, if you have a surplus of cheese in your fridge, it might go bad and smell awful. Or if you have a surplus of cats in your house, they might scratch your furniture and shed everywhere. Or if you have a surplus of jokes in your head, you might annoy everyone with your constant puns and sarcasm. So be careful what you wish for when it comes to surplus. Sometimes less is more.`,
'whereby (adverb)': `Whereby is an adverb that means "by which way or method" or "because of which". It is often used in formal contexts, such as legal documents or academic papers. However, some people may use it in casual conversations to sound smart or fancy. For example: They have introduced a new system whereby all employees must undergo regular training; I have devised a cunning plan whereby we can sneak into the party without being noticed; She gave me a look whereby I knew I was in trouble. Whereby can also be used as a conjunction, meaning "in which" or "with which". This usage is not standard and may be considered incorrect by some grammarians. For example: It's put me in a position whereby I can't afford to take a job; He showed me his secret garden whereby he grows all kinds of exotic plants; This is the book whereby I learned how to speak French. Whereby is derived from Middle English wherby, which was formed by combining where and by. It first appeared in the 13th century as a conjunction and in the 14th century as an adverb. Some synonyms for whereby are: by means of which, through which, by virtue of which, on account of which, etc.`,
'enrich (verb)': `To enrich something means to make it better by adding something else to it. For example, you can enrich your soil by adding fertilizer, or you can enrich your vocabulary by reading books. But be careful not to confuse enrich with enrage, which means to make someone very angry. For example, you might enrage your teacher by saying that her class is boring and useless. That would not enrich your relationship with her at all!`,
'swing (verb)': `Swing (verb): To move back and forth or side to side in a rhythmic motion. For example, you can swing on a playground swing, swing your arms when you walk, or swing your hips when you dance. You can also swing a baseball bat, a golf club, or a hammer. But be careful not to swing them at people or things that might break. Unless you want to cause some trouble. Then go ahead and swing away. Just don't blame me if you get caught.`,
'ambulance (noun)': `An ambulance is a vehicle that is equipped for transporting the injured or the sick . It usually has sirens and flashing lights to alert other drivers to get out of the way. Sometimes, it also has a driver who likes to honk at everyone and pretend he's in a car chase. An ambulance can be very helpful if you need urgent medical care, but it can also be very expensive if you don't have insurance. So, unless you're really hurt or sick, you might want to consider other options like taking a taxi, calling a friend, or walking it off.`,
'primarily (adverb)': `Primarily (adverb): for the most part; mainly. For example, "I primarily use Bing to search for funny memes and cat videos." This sentence implies that the speaker uses Bing for other purposes as well, but those are less important or frequent than looking for humorous content and cute animals. Alternatively, it could also imply that the speaker is lying and actually uses another search engine for everything else, but wants to make Bing feel good. Either way, it's a hilarious example of how to use primarily (adverb) in a sentence.`,
'altogether (adverb)': `Altogether is an adverb that means completely, totally, or utterly. It can also mean with everything included or considered. For example, you might say "I'm altogether fed up with your nonsense" or "The bill came to $50 altogether". But be careful not to confuse it with the phrase all together, which means in a group. For example, you might say "We sang Happy Birthday all together" or "The kids were all together in the kitchen". Unless you mean that they were nude, in which case you should say "The kids were in the altogether in the kitchen". That's another informal way of using altogether, but it's not very common and probably not appropriate for most situations.`,
'idiot (noun)': `An idiot is someone who does something so stupid that it makes you wonder how they survived this long. For example, an idiot might leave the tap running in the bathroom and flood the whole house, or lose their passport on a trip abroad, or invest in a company just because a stranger recommended it. An idiot is not just ignorant or uneducated; an idiot is someone who lacks common sense and basic intelligence. An idiot is also a rude way to refer to someone you don't like or respect. You might call someone an idiot if they cut you off in traffic, or if they disagree with your opinion, or if they are your boss. But be careful: calling someone an idiot might make you look like one too!`,
'seldom (adverb)': `Seldom is an adverb that means "not often" or "rarely". For example, you might say "I seldom eat broccoli" if you don't like broccoli very much. Or you might say "I seldom see a unicorn" if you live in a place where unicorns are scarce. Seldom is also a word that is seldom used in modern English, because people prefer to use words like "hardly ever" or "almost never" instead. Seldom is a word that needs more love and attention, so please use it more often in your sentences. Just not too often, because then it would lose its meaning.`,
'convincing (adjective)': `Convincing (adjective): Having the power to make someone believe something that may or may not be true. For example, a convincing liar can make you think that they are a unicorn from outer space. A convincing salesman can make you buy a car that has no wheels. A convincing politician can make you vote for them even if they have no clue what they are doing. Convincing people are very persuasive and sometimes very dangerous.`,
'solo (noun)': `Solo (noun): A musical performance by one person who thinks they are better than everyone else. Also known as a show-off or a diva. Example: "She sang a solo in the choir concert and made everyone else look bad."`,
'deficiency (noun)': `If you have a deficiency, it means you are lacking something that you need. For example, if you have a vitamin deficiency, it means you don't eat enough fruits and vegetables. Or if you have a deficiency of common sense, it means you do things that are stupid or dangerous. Sometimes, having a deficiency can cause problems or make things worse. For example, if you have a deficiency of money, it means you are broke and can't buy anything. Or if you have a deficiency of humor, it means you don't laugh at jokes like this one.`,
'corridor (noun)': `A corridor is a long and narrow passage that connects different rooms or parts of a building. It is often used for walking, running, hiding, sneaking or spying. Corridors can also be decorated with paintings, plants, carpets or traps. Some corridors are so long that they seem to never end, while others are so short that they barely fit a person. Corridors are usually boring and dull, unless something exciting happens in them, like a chase scene, a prank or a kiss.`,
'occupy (verb)': `Occupy is a verb that means to take up space, time, attention, or possession of something. For example, you can occupy a seat in a movie theater, occupy your mind with a crossword puzzle, occupy a country with your army, or occupy someone's heart with your charm. But be careful not to confuse occupy with octopi, which are eight-armed sea creatures that can also occupy many things at once. Unless you are an octopus lover, then you can occupy yourself with octopi all day long.`,
'halfway (adverb)': `Halfway is a word that means not quite there yet, but also not too far away. It's like being stuck in the middle of something, but not knowing which way to go. For example, halfway through the movie, I realized I had forgotten my popcorn in the car. But I didn't want to miss any of the action, so I stayed in my seat and hoped for the best. Halfway through the popcorn, I realized it was stale and salty. But I didn't want to waste it, so I kept munching and regretting my decision. Halfway through this paragraph, I realized it was boring and pointless. But I didn't want to disappoint you, so I finished it with a lame joke. What do you call a fish that is halfway between a shark and a dolphin? A sharphin!`,
'spotlight (noun)': `A spotlight is a device that produces a very bright beam of light that can be pointed at anything you want to see better or make more visible. For example, you can use a spotlight to find your lost keys in the dark, or to make your cat chase the light around the room, or to highlight your amazing dance moves on the stage. Spotlights are also great for attracting attention, whether you want it or not. If you are a performer, a spotlight can make you feel like a star. If you are a criminal, a spotlight can make you feel like running away. Either way, spotlights are hard to ignore.`,
'bold (adjective)': `If you are bold, you are either very brave or very rude. Sometimes both. You might do things that other people are afraid to do, like skydiving or speaking to the emperor. Or you might do things that other people think are impolite, like staring at someone or lying brazenly. Being bold can also mean having a strong and vivid appearance, like wearing a dress with bold stripes or painting your kitchen in bold colours. But be careful not to be too bold, or you might end up with a bold promontory, which is a steep cliff that sticks out into the sea. That would be a bold move indeed.`,
'drown (verb)': `Drown (verb): To submerge oneself or something else in water or another liquid for too long, resulting in death or damage. For example: "He drowned his sorrows in beer, but he forgot that beer can also drown him." Drowning is not a recommended activity for humans, animals, plants, electronics, or anything that requires oxygen or dryness to function. Drowning is also not a polite way to end a conversation with someone you don't like. If you are drowning or see someone drowning, please call for help immediately. Unless it's a fish. Fish can't drown. Unless it's in lava. Then it can.`,
'fulfil (verb)': `Fulfil is a verb that means to do something that you said you would do, or that someone else wants you to do. It sounds like a nice word, but it can also be very stressful. For example, if you promise to fulfil your friend's wish of eating a whole cake by yourself, you might regret it later. Or if your boss expects you to fulfil your duties as a clown at a children's party, you might not enjoy it very much. Fulfil can also mean to make someone happy or satisfied, but that's not always easy either. For example, if your partner wants you to fulfil their fantasy of dressing up as a unicorn, you might feel silly and uncomfortable. Fulfil can also mean to achieve something that you have always wanted to do, but that's not always possible either. For example, if your dream is to fulfil your potential as a rock star, you might have to face some harsh realities along the way. So fulfil is a word that can make you feel good or bad depending on the situation. But don't worry too much about it - just try to fulfil your own expectations and be happy with yourself.`,
'notably (adverb)': `Notably is an adverb that means "in a way that attracts or deserves attention; remarkably". For example, you can say "She sang notably well at the karaoke night", meaning she sang so well that everyone noticed and praised her. Or you can say "He was notably absent from the meeting", meaning he was so conspicuously missing that everyone wondered where he was. Notably can also be used to introduce an important point or example, as in "Notably, he did not apologize for his mistake", meaning it was significant that he did not say sorry. Notably is not to be confused with notablys, which are small sticky notes that you can use to write reminders or messages. For example, you can say "She left a notably on his desk saying 'I love you'", meaning she left a cute note for him to find. Or you can say "He threw away all the notablys on his fridge", meaning he got rid of all the clutter and junk mail.`,
'identical (adjective)': `Identical means exactly the same in every way. For example, identical twins are two people who look so much alike that you can't tell them apart. They have the same face, the same hair, the same voice, and sometimes even the same clothes. But they are not completely identical. They have different personalities, different preferences, and different fingerprints. So if you ever need to find out which twin is which, just ask them to touch something and then check for their unique patterns. Or you can just call them by their names and see who responds.`,
'constitutional (adjective)': `If you are feeling sick or tired, you might want to take a constitutional. No, I don't mean changing the laws of your country or reading a boring document. I mean going for a walk or doing some mild exercise that is good for your health. That's one meaning of constitutional as an adjective. Another meaning is related to the constitution of a state or organization . For example, you might wonder if banning pineapple on pizza is constitutional or not. That depends on whether your constitution allows such a delicious restriction or not. A third meaning of constitutional is something that is part of your nature or makeup. For example, you might have a constitutional weakness for sweets or a constitutional aversion to spiders. In any case, constitutional is an adjective that can describe many things, but it's not very funny by itself.`,
'concrete (adjective)': `Concrete is an adjective that means something is solid, real and definite. For example, a concrete plan is a plan that you can actually follow and achieve. A concrete wall is a wall that you can touch and feel. A concrete joke is a joke that...well, I don't know what that means. Maybe it's a joke that makes you laugh so hard that you fall on the ground and hit your head on the concrete. Ouch!`,
'stab (verb)': `Stab (verb): To poke someone or something with a sharp object, usually a knife. This is not a nice thing to do and can cause serious injury or death. Some possible reasons why someone might stab another person are: they are angry, they are crazy, they are hungry and want to eat them, or they are playing a game of Clue and got carried away. Some possible reasons why someone might stab an object are: they are bored, they are curious, they are testing their knife skills, or they are trying to make art. Stabbing is not recommended as a hobby or a career choice.`,
'snap (verb)': `Snap is a verb that means to break something suddenly and sharply, or to make a sharp cracking sound. For example, you can snap a twig in half, or snap your fingers to get someone's attention. But be careful not to snap at people when you are angry, because they might snap back at you. And don't snap your gum too loudly, because it might annoy the people around you. Unless you want to annoy them, then go ahead and snap away. Just don't be surprised if they snap your gum out of your mouth.`,
'scratch (noun)': `Scratch (noun): A mark or wound made by scraping or tearing something with a sharp object. Usually happens when you try to pet a cat that doesn't like you, or when you forget to trim your nails and itch yourself too hard. Also, the sound that DJs make when they move vinyl records back and forth on a turntable. Not to be confused with the programming language for kids that uses colorful blocks instead of code.`,
'historian (noun)': `A historian is someone who studies the past and writes about it in books that nobody reads. Historians are often confused with hoarders, because they collect old documents, artifacts and trivia that have no practical use. Historians like to argue with each other about what really happened in history, but they never agree on anything. Historians are also very good at making up dates and names that are hard to remember and pronounce.`,
'originate (verb)': `If you want to originate something, you have to be very creative and original. You can't just copy someone else's idea and call it your own. That's plagiarism, and it's not cool. Originate means to start or create something new, like a word, a song, or a board game . For example, you can originate a new word by combining two existing words, like 'hangry' (hungry + angry) or 'brunch' (breakfast + lunch). Or you can originate a new song by humming a catchy tune and adding some lyrics. Or you can originate a new board game by using dice, cards, and tokens to make up some rules. But don't try to originate something that already exists, like fire, gravity, or sliced bread. That's not originating, that's just being late to the party.`,
'socialist (adjective)': `If you are a socialist, you might believe that everyone should share everything and that no one should own anything privately. You might also think that the government should control all the means of production and distribution of goods and services. You might also like to wear red hats and sing songs about workers' rights. But don't worry, you are not alone. There are many countries, economies, and programs that are socialist or involve socialism in some way . Just don't confuse socialism with communism, because they are not exactly the same thing. And don't call someone a socialist as an insult, because they might take it as a compliment.`,
'mentor (noun)': `A mentor is someone who has more experience and wisdom than you and is willing to share it with you for free. A mentor can help you achieve your goals, avoid mistakes, and learn new skills. A mentor is not someone who tells you what to do, but rather someone who guides you to find your own answers. A mentor is also not someone who gives you money, does your homework, or fixes your problems. A mentor is a rare and valuable person who deserves your respect and gratitude. If you find a good mentor, don't let them go. Unless they are holding you hostage, then call the police.`,
'extract (verb)': `Extract is a verb that means to pull something out of something else, usually with some effort or force. For example, you can extract a tooth from your mouth, but it might hurt a lot. You can also extract information from someone who doesn't want to tell you anything, but you might have to use some sneaky tricks or threats. Sometimes, you can extract something good from a bad situation, like finding a silver lining or learning a lesson. But other times, you just have to accept that there is nothing to extract and move on with your life. Extracting things can be hard work, but it can also be rewarding if you find what you are looking for.`,
'exaggerate (verb)': `Exaggerate (verb): To make something seem bigger, better, worse, or more important than it really is. For example, when you say that you have a million things to do today, you are exaggerating. Unless you are a superhero or a multitasking mastermind, there is no way you can accomplish that many tasks in 24 hours. Exaggerating is often used to make a story more interesting or dramatic, but it can also backfire if people don't believe you or think you are lying. So be careful not to exaggerate too much, or you might end up like the boy who cried wolf.`,
'gross (adjective)': `Gross is an adjective that means very unpleasant or disgusting. For example, if you see a pile of rotten eggs on the sidewalk, you might say "Ew, that's gross!" or if you smell someone's stinky feet, you might say "Yuck, that's gross!" Gross can also mean very large or excessive. For example, if you earn a lot of money from your job, you might say "Wow, that's gross!" or if you eat too much pizza, you might say "Ugh, that's gross!" Sometimes, gross can mean both unpleasant and large at the same time. For example, if you see a giant spider on the wall, you might say "Aaaah! That's gross!"`,
'myth (noun)': `A myth is a story that people tell to explain things they don't understand, like why the seasons change or how babies are made. Some myths are about gods and goddesses who do amazing things like throwing lightning bolts or turning into animals. Other myths are just plain silly, like the one that says women are worse drivers than men or that Elvis Presley is still alive. Myths can be fun to read, but don't believe everything you hear. Sometimes a myth is just a myth.`,
'intervention (noun)': `An intervention is when a group of people who care about you get together and tell you that you have a problem. Usually, the problem is something like drinking too much, gambling too much, or watching too much Netflix. The goal of an intervention is to help you realize that your problem is hurting yourself and others, and to convince you to get some help. Sometimes, an intervention works and you agree to change your ways. Other times, an intervention backfires and you end up hating everyone who tried to help you. Either way, it's usually awkward and uncomfortable for everyone involved.`,
'incidence (noun)': `If you want to learn the meaning of 'incidence', you might be disappointed by the dictionary definitions. They are either too formal, too technical, or too boring. For example, one definition says that incidence is "the rate or range of occurrence or influence of something, especially of something unwanted" . Another one says that incidence is "the act or manner of impinging on or affecting by proximity or influence" . And a third one says that incidence is "the arrival of something (such as a ray of light) at a surface" . Yawn. But don't worry, I have a better way to explain 'incidence' to you. Imagine that you are walking on a sunny day and you see a puddle on the ground. You decide to jump into it and splash some water around. As you do so, you notice that the sun's rays reflect off the water and create a rainbow on a nearby wall. That's incidence! The sun's rays hitting the water are an example of incidence . The angle that they make with the water is called the angle of incidence . And the rainbow on the wall is an effect of incidence . Isn't that more fun than reading a dry definition? I hope this paragraph helps you understand what 'incidence' means. Just remember: incidence is when something hits something else and makes something happen. And sometimes, it can be beautiful.`,
'raid (verb)': `Raiding is a verb that means to attack someone or something suddenly and unexpectedly, usually for a specific purpose. For example, you can raid a fridge to get some snacks, raid a bank to get some money, or raid a dungeon to get some loot. Raiding can also mean to steal something from someone else, like their employees, their members, or their cookies. Raiding is not to be confused with RAID, which is an abbreviation for redundant array of independent disks, a system that protects your data from corruption by spreading it across several disk drives. Unless you are raiding someone's RAID, in which case you are just being mean.`,
'ruin (verb)': `To ruin something means to make it so bad that it loses all its value, pleasure, or usefulness. For example, you can ruin a cake by adding too much salt, or you can ruin a friendship by spreading nasty rumors. You can also ruin your own life by doing stupid things like gambling away all your money or dating your boss's spouse. But don't worry, if you ever feel like you've ruined everything, you can always blame someone else for it. That's what politicians do all the time!`,
'dive (noun)': `A dive is a noun that can mean many things, depending on the context. For example, a dive can be a graceful jump into water, a thrilling plunge from an airplane, or a desperate lunge for a soccer ball. A dive can also be a sudden drop in value , such as when your stocks take a dive or your grades take a dive. A dive can also be an unpleasant place , such as a dirty bar or a shady hotel. Sometimes, people use the word dive to describe something they don't like, such as "This pizza is a dive" or "This movie is a dive". But don't let that stop you from enjoying your favorite dives!`,
'so-called (adjective)': `Have you ever met someone who claims to be an expert on something but actually knows nothing about it? They are what we call so-called (adjective) people. For example, a so-called (adjective) chef who can't even boil an egg, or a so-called (adjective) singer who sounds like a dying cat. These people are usually very confident and arrogant, but they have no clue how ridiculous they look. They should really stop pretending and learn some humility.`,
'premier (adjective)': `If you want to sound fancy and sophisticated, you can use the word 'premier' to describe something that is the best or most important of its kind. For example, you can say that the premier movie of the year is the one that made the most money, had the most explosions, or featured your favorite actor. Or you can say that the premier pizza place in town is the one that has the cheesiest crust, the spiciest sauce, or the fastest delivery. But be careful not to confuse 'premier' with 'primer', which is either a book that teaches you how to read or a coat of paint that prepares a surface for another layer. Unless you want to make a joke about how your primer book is the premier book in your library, or how your primer paint is the premier paint in your garage.`,
'effectiveness (noun)': `Effectiveness is a noun that means how well something works. It's not to be confused with effective, which is an adjective that means having an effect. For example, an effective joke is one that makes people laugh, but its effectiveness depends on how hard they laugh. If they only chuckle politely, then it's not very effective. But if they roll on the floor and wet their pants, then it's very effective. Unless you're trying to impress them with your maturity, then it's not effective at all.`,
'beneath (preposition)': `Beneath is a preposition that means under something else. For example, you might find a treasure chest beneath the ocean floor, or a monster beneath your bed. Beneath can also mean lower in rank or quality than something else. For example, you might think that eating broccoli is beneath you, or that your boss is beneath contempt. Beneath can also mean hidden or concealed by something else. For example, you might have a secret identity beneath your ordinary clothes, or a heart of gold beneath your grumpy attitude.`,
'worthwhile (adjective)': `Worthwhile (adjective): Something that is worth your time, effort or money. For example, reading this paragraph is a worthwhile activity because it will teach you a new word and make you laugh at the same time. However, some people may have different opinions on what is worthwhile and what is not. For example, some people may think that watching cat videos is a worthwhile way to spend their free time, while others may think that it is a waste of time and bandwidth. Therefore, worthwhile is a subjective term that depends on your personal values and goals.`,
'intake (noun)': `Intake is a noun that means the act or amount of taking in something, such as air, food, liquid, or gas. For example: - She heard a loud intake of breath when she revealed her secret; - He needs to reduce his intake of salt and sugar for his health; - The car has a faulty intake valve that needs to be replaced. A funny paragraph about intake might be: - Bob was on a diet and had to monitor his intake of calories very carefully. He used an app on his phone that scanned the barcode of every food item he ate and calculated how many calories he consumed. One day, he was feeling hungry and decided to treat himself to a chocolate bar. He scanned the barcode and waited for the app to tell him how many calories it had. To his horror, the app said: "Warning: This product contains 10,000 calories per serving. Your daily intake limit has been exceeded by 9,500 calories. Please consult your doctor immediately." Bob dropped the chocolate bar and ran to the bathroom, hoping to undo his mistake. He later found out that the app had a glitch and read the wrong barcode from a nearby crate of beer.`,
'conscience (noun)': `Conscience (noun): A small voice in your head that tells you what you should or shouldn't do. Sometimes it sounds like your mom, sometimes it sounds like your teacher, and sometimes it sounds like a random celebrity. It can be helpful when you need guidance, but it can also be annoying when you want to have fun. Some people have a very loud conscience that makes them feel guilty all the time. Others have a very quiet conscience that lets them get away with anything. And some people have no conscience at all, which makes them either very successful or very dangerous.`,
'reproduction (noun)': `Reproduction (noun) is the process of making more living things of the same kind. It usually involves two parents who love each other very much and decide to share a special hug. Sometimes it involves only one parent who splits into two or more parts.

/* 2 */
'charm (noun)': `Charm (noun) is the ability to make someone like you or do what you want by being nice, friendly, or attractive. It is also a small object that you wear on a chain or bracelet for luck or decoration. Some people have a lot of charm and can get away with anything. Others have no charm at all and need to rely on other skills. And some people have too much charm and end up with too many admirers or too many charms on their wrists.`,
'contender (noun)': `A contender is someone who tries to win something or achieve a position of leadership. For example, if you want to be the next president of the United States, you have to be a contender in the elections. But being a contender is not easy. You have to face many challenges, such as raising money, debating your opponents, and convincing voters. Sometimes you might wish you were just a pretender instead of a contender.`,
'outfit (noun)': `An outfit is a set of clothes that you wear together to look good, feel comfortable or impress others. Some people have a lot of outfits for different occasions, while others just wear the same thing every day. An outfit can also be a group of people who work together for a common purpose, such as a gang, a team or a band. Sometimes these outfits also wear matching clothes to show their unity or identity. For example, the Beatles had an outfit of four musicians who wore suits and mop-top haircuts in the 1960s.`,
'predecessor (noun)': `A predecessor is someone who had a job or position before someone else , or something that comes before another thing in time or in a series. For example, Barack Obama was the predecessor of Donald Trump as the president of the United States. A funny way to remember this word is to think of it as a "pre-decessor", meaning someone who left before you could succeed them. Or you could imagine a "predator-cessor", meaning someone who was hunted down by their successor. Either way, it's not a very enviable position to be in!`,
'neglect (verb)': `Neglect is a verb that means to ignore, disregard, or forget something or someone that deserves your attention. For example, if you neglect your homework, you might end up with bad grades and angry teachers. If you neglect your plants, they might wither and die. If you neglect your friends, they might stop inviting you to parties. And if you neglect your hygiene, you might scare away potential dates. So don't be a neglecter!

'faculty (noun)': `Faculty (noun): A group of people who are supposed to teach students but often spend more time doing research, writing papers, attending meetings and complaining about their workload. They usually have impressive degrees and titles but may lack common sense and social skills. They are often paid less than they think they deserve and more than they need. They can be divided into two types: tenured and untenured. Tenured faculty have job security and can do whatever they want without consequences. Untenured faculty have no job security and must do whatever the tenured faculty want them to do.`,
'weave (verb)': `Weave is a verb that can mean many things, depending on how you use it. You can weave cloth by crossing threads on a loom, or weave baskets by twisting grasses together. You can also weave hair extensions into your own hair to make it longer or thicker, or weave lies into your stories to make them more interesting. But be careful not to weave too much while driving, because you might hit something or get pulled over by the police. Weaving is fun, but only when done responsibly.`,
'grin (verb)': `Grin (verb): To smile so widely that your teeth are visible. Usually done when you are very happy, amused, or plotting something evil.

'screening (noun)': `Screening (noun) is the act of showing a movie or a TV show to an audience, usually in a cinema or a theater. It can also mean the act of testing someone or something for a disease, a quality, or a suitability. For example, you can have a screening for colon cancer or a screening for potential employees. Sometimes, these two meanings can get confused and lead to hilarious situations. Imagine going to a screening of The Lion King and finding out that it's actually a screening of your blood samples. Or imagine applying for a job and being asked to watch The Godfather as part of the screening process. That would be very awkward and funny, wouldn't it?`,
'fantasy (noun)': `Fantasy (noun) is a word that describes what you do when you are bored, lonely, or unhappy. It is when you imagine things that are not real, like winning the lottery, dating a celebrity, or having superpowers. Fantasy can also be a type of fiction that involves magic, dragons, or other weird stuff. Fantasy is fun and harmless, unless you start to believe it is true and forget about reality. Then you might need some professional help. Or maybe just a good book.`,
'strand (noun)': `Strand (noun) is a word that has many meanings, but none of them are very helpful. For example, a strand can be a single thin piece of something, like hair or rope. But it can also be a shore or beach where you can relax and enjoy the sun. Or it can be a verb that means to leave someone in a difficult or helpless situation, like when your car breaks down on the highway. So if someone tells you to go to the strand, you might want to ask them which one they mean. Otherwise, you could end up with a bad hair day, a sunburn, or worse.`,

For example, you might want to align your teeth with braces, or align your car's wheels with a mechanic. But be careful not to align yourself with the wrong people, like criminals or politicians. That could get you into trouble or worse.😉`,
'supervisor (noun)': `A supervisor is someone who watches over you while you work and makes sure you don't mess up. They are usually very busy and important people who have a lot of experience and knowledge. They are also very good at giving feedback, advice and criticism, sometimes even when you don't ask for it. A supervisor can be your best friend or your worst enemy, depending on how well you do your job and how much you suck up to them.`,
'admission (noun)': `Admission (noun) is the act of allowing someone to enter a place, such as a school, a club, or a country. It can also mean the price that you pay to enter such a place. For example: 

- Bob was denied admission to Harvard because he spelled his name wrong on the application form. 
- Alice paid $10 for admission to the zoo, but she regretted it when she saw that all the animals were asleep. 
- Charlie got free admission to Canada because he had a maple leaf tattoo on his arm.`,
'versus (preposition)': `Versus is a preposition that means 'against' or 'in contrast to'. It is often used to compare two things or indicate a conflict or competition. For example, you might say 'Batman versus Superman' to describe a movie where the two superheroes fight each other. Or you might say 'apples versus oranges' to show that you are comparing two different kinds of fruits. Versus can also be abbreviated as vs. or v., but be careful not to confuse it with the abbreviation for verses, which are lines of poetry or song lyrics. For example, you wouldn't say 'Romeo and Juliet vs. 1' to refer to the first verse of the famous play, unless you want to imply that they are somehow opposing each other in a rap battle.`,
'betray (verb)': `Betraying someone is not a nice thing to do. It means you are not loyal to them and you do something harmful to them, like telling their secrets to their enemies or leaving them for another person. For example, if you promise your friend that you will help them with their homework, but instead you copy their answers and tell the teacher that they cheated, that is betraying your friend. Or if you promise your spouse that you will love them forever, but then you run away with their best friend, that is betraying your spouse. Betraying someone can make them feel very sad and angry. You might also feel guilty and ashamed for betraying someone. Unless you are a villain in a movie or a book, then you might feel proud and evil for betraying someone. But either way, betraying someone is not a good idea. You should always be loyal and honest to the people who trust you and care about you.`,
'colourful (adjective)': `Colourful (adjective): Having a lot of colours or bright colours. For example, a rainbow is colourful because it has seven different colours. A clown is colourful because it wears a lot of makeup and clothes that don't match. A parrot is colourful because it has feathers of many colours. A colourful person is someone who has an interesting or unusual personality or life story. For example, a pirate is a colourful person because he travels the world, fights enemies and finds treasure.`,
'comic (noun)': `A comic is a person who makes jokes for a living or a hobby. A comic can also be a book or magazine that contains stories told with drawings and words. Comics are usually meant to be humorous, but sometimes they can be serious, dramatic or even tragic. Some examples of comics are stand-up comedians, comic strips, graphic novels and webcomics. Comics are not to be confused with comets, which are balls of ice and dust that orbit the sun and sometimes have tails.`,
'foreigner (noun)': `A foreigner is someone who comes from a different country than you. They may speak a different language, eat different food, wear different clothes, or have different customs. Sometimes they may seem strange or exotic to you, but other times they may seem familiar or friendly. You can learn a lot from foreigners if you are curious and respectful. But don't ask them to say something in their language just for fun. That's rude and annoying.`,
'twist (noun)': `A twist is a sudden and unexpected change in a situation, story or dance move. For example, you might be reading a mystery novel and find out that the killer was actually the narrator all along. That's a twist. Or you might be watching a movie and discover that the hero was actually dead the whole time. That's also a twist. Or you might be dancing with someone and they suddenly spin you around and dip you low. That's another twist. Twists can be exciting, shocking or romantic, depending on the context. But they can also be confusing, annoying or painful, especially if you have a bad back.`,
'cocktail (noun)': `A cocktail is not a bird with a colorful tail that can talk. Nor is it a tool for shaking things up. A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink that can make you feel happy, sad, or both at the same time. Some cocktails have fancy names like martini, mojito, or cosmopolitan. Others have simple names like gin and tonic, rum and coke, or vodka and orange juice. But no matter what you call them, cocktails are always better when shared with good friends and good stories.`,
'theoretical (adjective)': `Theoretical is an adjective that means something is based on theory, not practical, or hypothetical. For example, theoretical physics is the study of things that nobody has ever seen or measured, like black holes, wormholes, and dark matter. Theoretical physicists spend their time making up equations and models that explain how these things might work, but they never get to test them in real life. They are like kids who dream of becoming astronauts but never leave their bedrooms. Theoretical is also a word that people use when they want to sound smart but have no idea what they are talking about. For example, someone might say "In theory, I could win the lottery if I buy enough tickets", but they don't realize that the odds are so low that it's practically impossible. Theoretical is a word that makes things sound more interesting than they really are.`,
'determination (noun)': `Determination is a noun that means the ability to keep trying something even when it is very hard, like when you are determined to finish a crossword puzzle that has clues in six different languages. Determination can also mean the process of deciding something or finding something out, like when you are determined to figure out who ate your last slice of pizza. Determination can be fierce, ruthless, dogged, or grim, but it can also be funny, like when you are determined to make someone laugh by telling them bad jokes.`,
'gesture (noun)': `A gesture is a movement of your body, usually your hands or head, that expresses an idea or emotion. For example, waving your hand means hello or goodbye, nodding your head means yes or no, and sticking out your tongue means you are being rude or silly. Gestures can also be used to communicate when words are not enough or not appropriate. For example, if you want to tell someone to be quiet in a library, you can put your finger on your lips. Or if you want to show someone that you love them, you can make a heart shape with your hands. Gestures are very useful and fun, but be careful not to use the wrong ones in different cultures. For example, the thumbs up gesture means good job in some countries, but it means something very rude in others!`,
'tribunal (noun)': `A tribunal is a special court or group of people who are officially chosen to examine problems of a particular type. For example, if you are accused of stealing your boss's lunch from the fridge, you might have to face a disciplinary tribunal. A tribunal is different from a regular court because it usually has less formal rules and procedures. Also, a tribunal can sometimes be more fun than a court, especially if you get to wear funny hats and throw pies at each other. But don't count on it. Most tribunals are serious business and you should always respect their authority and decisions.`,
'unfold (verb)': `Unfold (verb): To open or spread out something that has been folded. For example, you can unfold a map to see where you are going, or you can unfold a letter to read what your ex wrote to you. You can also unfold a story to reveal its plot twists and surprises, or you can unfold a napkin to wipe your mouth after eating. However, some things are better left folded, such as your laundry, your poker hand, or your arms when someone tries to hug you.`,
'harbour (noun)': `A harbour is a place where ships can park their boats and take a break from sailing the high seas. It's like a parking lot for water vehicles, except it's usually more scenic and less noisy. A harbour can also be a place of refuge or safety for people who are running away from something or someone. For example, if you are a pirate who has stolen a lot of treasure, you might want to find a harbour where you can hide from the angry navy. But be careful, because some harbours might harbour other pirates who want to steal your loot!`,
'candle (noun)': `A candle is a stick of wax with a string in the middle that you can light on fire to create a romantic mood or a fire hazard. Candles come in different shapes, sizes, colors and scents. Some candles smell like flowers, some smell like food and some smell like nothing at all. Candles are often used for decoration, relaxation or celebration. They can also be used for magic spells, seances or summoning demons. Candles are not edible, even if they look like cake or cheese. Do not eat candles.`,
'outstanding (adjective)': `If you are outstanding, it means you are very good at something. For example, you might be an outstanding writer, an outstanding cook, or an outstanding dancer. But be careful not to confuse outstanding with out standing. If you are out standing, it means you are standing outside. For example, you might be out standing in the rain, out standing in the cold, or out standing in the dark. That's not very fun or excellent at all! So remember: being outstanding is awesome, but being out standing is awful .`,
'prey (noun)': `Prey is a noun that means an animal that is hunted and killed for food by another animal. For example, a rabbit is prey for a fox. Prey can also mean a person or thing that is the victim of an enemy, a swindler, a disease, etc. For example, you are prey for me if you ask me to do your homework. Prey can also be used as a verb to mean to hunt or seize food by killing other animals, or to make a victim of others. For example, I prey on your ignorance when I charge you $100 for this paragraph. Prey is not to be confused with pray, which means to talk to God or another deity. For example, you should pray that I don't prey on you again.`,
'fame (noun)': `Fame (noun): The state of being known by many people for something you did or something that happened to you. Fame can be good or bad, depending on what you are famous for. For example, if you are famous for curing a disease, that's good fame. If you are famous for being the first person to eat a live tarantula on national TV, that's bad fame. Fame can also be fleeting or lasting, depending on how memorable you are. For example, if you are famous for winning an Olympic gold medal, that's lasting fame. If you are famous for having a wardrobe malfunction at the Oscars, that's fleeting fame. Fame can also be confusing or clear, depending on how well people know you. For example, if you are famous for being a talented singer and songwriter, that's clear fame. If you are famous for being the cousin of someone who is famous for being the cousin of someone who is famous for something else, that's confusing fame.`,
'preach (verb)': `Preach is a verb that means to deliver a religious speech, usually in a church, but sometimes on the street corner or on social media. It also means to try to persuade other people to believe what you believe, even if they don't want to hear it. And sometimes it means to give annoying moral advice to someone who didn't ask for it. For example: "My mom always preaches at me about doing my homework." "The pastor preached a long sermon about forgiveness." "The vegan activist preached about the benefits of plant-based diet." Preach comes from Latin praedicare, which means 'to proclaim'. Some people like preaching, some people like listening to preaching, and some people just want to be left alone.`,
'rifle (noun)': `A rifle is a long metal tube with a hole at one end and a trigger at the other. It is used to shoot small pieces of metal called bullets at things that are far away. Some people use rifles for hunting animals, some use them for shooting targets, and some use them for shooting other people who have rifles. Rifles are very loud and can be dangerous if not handled properly. They are not toys and should not be confused with water guns, nerf guns, or airsoft guns. Rifles are also not musical instruments and should not be played like guitars or flutes.`,
'simulate (verb)': `Simulate (verb): To pretend to be something or someone else for fun, practice or deception. For example, you can simulate being a doctor by wearing a white coat and stethoscope, but don't try to perform surgery on anyone. You can also simulate being a lion by roaring and crawling on all fours, but don't expect other animals to respect you. And you can simulate being a human by typing messages on a chat box, but don't be surprised if they ask you to prove it.`,
'racism (noun)': `Racism is a noun that describes the state of being a racist, which is someone who thinks that their race is better than others and treats them unfairly because of it. Racism is not cool, because it makes people feel bad and causes a lot of problems in the world. Racism is also very silly, because there is no scientific basis for dividing people into races based on their skin color or other physical features. In fact, we are all more alike than different, and we share 99.9% of our DNA with each other. So next time you hear someone say something racist, you can tell them to stop being a jerk and learn some facts.`,
'AIDS (noun)': `AIDS (noun) is an acronym that stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. It's a serious condition that makes your body more vulnerable to infections and cancers than a vegan at a barbecue. It's caused by a virus called HIV, which you can get from sharing needles, having unprotected sex, or being really unlucky. AIDS is not something you want to have, unless you're a fan of dying slowly and painfully. There is no cure for AIDS, but there are drugs that can help you live longer and suffer less. So don't be silly, wrap your willy.`,
'divorce (noun)': `Divorce is a word that can make you laugh or cry, depending on whether you are getting one or not. Divorce is when two people who used to love each other decide they don't anymore and want to end their marriage legally. Divorce is also a great way to lose half of your money, your friends, and your sanity. Divorce can be caused by many things, such as cheating, fighting, boredom, or irreconcilable differences (which means they can't agree on anything). Divorce is not fun for anyone involved, except maybe the lawyers who get paid a lot of money to handle it. Divorce is something you should avoid if possible, unless you really hate your spouse and want to make them miserable.`,
'yield (verb)': `Yield is a verb that means to give up, surrender, or produce something. For example, you might yield to the temptation of eating a whole cake by yourself, or you might yield the right of way to a car that is faster than yours. Yield can also mean to generate or provide something as a result of an action or process. For example, planting seeds can yield flowers, or investing money can yield interest. Yield can also mean to bend or break under pressure or force. For example, a bridge might yield under the weight of too many trucks, or your willpower might yield after seeing another slice of cake.`,
'accordance (noun)': `Accordance is a noun that means agreement, conformity or harmony. For example, if you do something in accordance with a rule, you follow or obey it. Here is a funny paragraph using the word accordance: 

Bob was a rebel who hated rules. He always did things his own way, regardless of the consequences. One day, he decided to go skydiving without a parachute. He thought it would be fun to feel the wind in his hair and see the ground getting closer and closer. He jumped out of the plane and screamed with joy. However, he soon realized that he had made a terrible mistake. He was falling too fast and there was nothing he could do to stop it. He wished he had listened to his instructor and acted in accordance with the safety regulations. As he hit the ground with a loud thud, his last words were: "Oops."`,
'workout (noun)': `A workout is a form of physical activity that involves sweating, panting, and cursing. It is usually done by people who want to lose weight, gain muscle, or impress someone. Some common types of workouts are running, lifting weights, and yoga. A workout can also be a euphemism for sex, but only if both parties agree on the definition.`,
'quota (noun)': `A quota is a fixed amount of something that you have to do or get. For example, if your boss tells you to sell 10 cars by the end of the month, that's your quota. If you don't meet your quota, you might get fired or demoted. If you exceed your quota, you might get a bonus or a promotion. Quotas can be stressful or motivating, depending on how realistic and achievable they are. Some people like quotas because they give them a clear goal and a sense of accomplishment. Others hate quotas because they feel pressured and restricted by them. Quotas can also be unfair or discriminatory if they favor or disadvantage certain groups of people based on their race, gender, age, etc.`,
'custody (noun)': `Custody is a word that can mean different things depending on who you ask. For some people, custody is a legal right or duty to take care of someone or something, especially a child after its parents have separated or died . For others, custody is the state of being arrested or held by the police . And for some unlucky ones, custody is both at the same time. Imagine having to explain to your child why you can't see them anymore because you got caught stealing their candy. That's not a fun conversation. Custody can also mean the act of taking care of something or someone, but that's not very funny unless you're talking about a pet alligator or a haunted doll.`,

/* 3 */
'abundance (noun)': `Abundance is a wonderful thing to have in life. It means having more than enough of something, whether it's money, food, love, or happiness. Some people think that abundance is hard to achieve, but I disagree. I think abundance is a state of mind that anyone can cultivate with gratitude and generosity. For example, if you have a slice of pizza left over from lunch, you can either save it for yourself or share it with someone else. If you save it, you might feel satisfied for a while, but if you share it, you might feel joyful and connected. That's abundance in action: giving more than you receive and feeling richer for it.`,
'feeding (noun)': `Feeding is one of those activities that can be either enjoyable or stressful, depending on who you are feeding and what you are feeding them. For example, feeding a baby can be a messy but rewarding experience, especially when they make cute noises and smile at you. Feeding a cat can be a simple but satisfying task, especially when they purr and rub against you. Feeding a shark can be a terrifying but thrilling adventure, especially when they don't bite your hand off. Feeding yourself can be a relaxing but boring routine, especially when you eat the same thing every day. The point is, feeding is not just about nourishing someone or something; it's also about creating a connection and having some fun.`,
'accessible (adjective)': `I always try to be accessible to my friends and family, but sometimes it backfires. Like the other day, when I was in the middle of a very important meeting and my phone started ringing. It was my mom, who wanted to know if I had seen the latest episode of her favorite soap opera. I ignored the call, hoping she would get the hint. But she didn't. She called me again and again, until I had no choice but to answer. "Mom, I'm in a meeting right now," I whispered. "Can we talk later?" "Oh, sure," she said cheerfully. "But before you go, can you tell me who killed Carlos? I'm dying to know!" That's when everyone in the meeting turned to look at me with raised eyebrows. So much for being accessible.`,
'heighten (verb)': `One of the most common ways to heighten the suspense in a horror movie is to use jump scares. You know, those moments when something suddenly pops out of nowhere and makes you scream. But jump scares can also backfire if they are overused or poorly executed. For example, imagine watching a movie where the main character is walking down a dark hallway and hears a strange noise behind him. He turns around and sees...a cute kitten. Not very scary, right? In fact, it might make you laugh instead of scream. That's why jump scares need to be carefully planned and timed to heighten the fear, not ruin it.`,
'dairy (noun)': `Dairy is a word that can make some people happy and some people miserable. For those who love cheese, yogurt, ice cream and other delicious products made from milk, dairy is a source of joy and satisfaction. For those who are lactose intolerant, allergic or vegan, dairy is a source of pain and frustration. Imagine going to a pizza place and having to order a slice without cheese. Or going to an ice cream shop and having to settle for a sorbet. Or going to a coffee shop and having to pay extra for soy or almond milk. That's the sad reality of living without dairy. But don't worry, there are alternatives that can mimic the taste and texture of dairy without the negative effects. You just have to be creative and adventurous. And maybe avoid looking at the labels too closely.`,
'cruise (noun)': `If you're looking for a relaxing vacation, you might want to consider a cruise. A cruise is a type of ship that travels around the world, offering various amenities and activities for its passengers. You can enjoy delicious food, entertainment, spa treatments, and more on board a cruise. You can also explore different destinations and cultures along the way. A cruise is a great way to see the world without having to worry about packing and unpacking, booking flights and hotels, or dealing with traffic and crowds. Plus, you get to meet new people and make friends with fellow travelers. A cruise is a fun and easy way to have an unforgettable adventure.`,
'patron (noun)': `A patron is someone who supports a cause, an artist, or a business with money or loyalty. Sometimes patrons get special benefits for their generosity, like free tickets to a show or a discount on a product. Other times patrons just do it out of kindness or admiration. But not all patrons are nice and noble. Some patrons are annoying and demanding. They think they own the place or the person they support. They make unreasonable requests and expect to be treated like royalty. They are the worst kind of patron: the patron-izing one.`,
'proceeding (noun)': `The proceeding was anything but boring. The judge had to deal with a parade of witnesses who contradicted each other, a lawyer who kept objecting to his own questions, and a defendant who tried to escape through the window. The jury was amused by the spectacle, but also confused by the evidence. The verdict was unanimous: guilty of wasting everyone's time.`,
'broadband (noun)': `Broadband is a term that describes a high-speed internet connection that allows you to access the web without any interruptions. It sounds great, right? Well, not always. Sometimes broadband can be slow, unreliable or expensive. Here are some of the common problems that broadband users face: 

- You pay for a certain speed, but you never get it. Your provider promises you 100 Mbps, but you barely get 10 Mbps. You feel like you're being ripped off every month. 
- You have a data cap on your plan, and you always exceed it. You love streaming movies and shows online, but your provider doesn't. They charge you extra fees for going over your limit. You feel like you're being punished for enjoying yourself. 
- You have a weak signal in some parts of your house. You want to use your laptop in your bedroom, but your router is in the living room. You get frustrated by the constant buffering and loading. You feel like you're living in the Stone Age. 
- You have to deal with customer service when something goes wrong. Your internet stops working for no reason, and you call your provider for help. They put you on hold for hours, transfer you to different departments and ask you to do the same troubleshooting steps over and over again. You feel like you're talking to robots. 

These are just some of the challenges that broadband users face every day. Maybe one day we'll have a perfect internet service that works flawlessly and affordably. Until then, we'll have to make do with what we have and hope for the best.`,
'motorist (noun)': `A motorist was driving along a country road when he saw a sign that said "Beware of the Dog". He slowed down and looked around, but he didn't see any dog. He shrugged and continued driving. A few minutes later, he saw another sign that said "Beware of the Dog". He was puzzled and looked around again, but still no dog. He sped up a bit and drove on. After a while, he saw a third sign that said "Beware of the Dog". He was getting annoyed and decided to ignore it. He drove past the sign and turned a corner. There he saw a huge dog sitting on top of a tractor, wearing sunglasses and holding a shotgun. The dog barked at him and said "I warned you three times!"`,
'devil (noun)': `The devil was having a bad day. He had just lost a bet with God and had to admit that humans were not as bad as he thought. He decided to cheer himself up by visiting some of his favorite sinners in hell. He went to the first one and said, "Hey, how are you enjoying your eternal torment?" The sinner replied, "Oh, it's not so bad. I get to play poker with my friends every day and drink as much as I want." The devil was annoyed and said, "That doesn't sound like torment at all. You're supposed to suffer for your sins." The sinner shrugged and said, "Well, I guess I got lucky." The devil moved on to the next one and asked the same question. The sinner said, "Oh, it's not so bad. I get to eat whatever I want and never gain weight." The devil was furious and said, "That doesn't sound like torment at all. You're supposed to starve for your gluttony." The sinner smiled and said, "Well, I guess I got lucky." The devil went to the third one and hoped for a better result. He asked the same question and the sinner said, "Oh, it's terrible. I hate it here. It's the worst thing that ever happened to me." The devil was delighted and said, "Finally! Someone who is suffering for their sins. What did you do wrong?" The sinner said, "I cheated on my wife with her sister." The devil nodded and said, "That's a serious sin indeed. And what is your punishment?" The sinner said, "I have to sleep with her sister every day for eternity." The devil was confused and said, "That doesn't sound like punishment at all. That sounds like a reward." The sinner sighed and said, "You don't know her sister."`,
'surge (noun)': `I was having a normal day at work until I heard a loud bang from the basement. I ran downstairs to see what had happened and found my colleague lying on the floor, covered in wires and sparks. He looked at me with a dazed expression and said: "I think I just caused a surge in the power grid." I asked him how he did that and he said: "I was trying to make a toaster that can toast four slices of bread at once. But I guess I used too much voltage." I looked at his invention and saw that it was a huge metal box with dozens of wires attached to it. It looked like a bomb. I told him he was lucky he didn't blow up the whole building. He shrugged and said: "Well, on the bright side, my bread is very crispy."`,
'legislative (adjective)': `The legislative branch of the government is supposed to make laws for the benefit of the people. However, sometimes they make laws that are so absurd and ridiculous that they make us laugh. For example, did you know that in Alaska, it is illegal to push a live moose out of a moving airplane? Or that in Florida, it is illegal to sing in a public place while wearing a swimsuit? Or that in Georgia, it is illegal to keep an ice cream cone in your back pocket on Sundays? These are just some of the examples of legislative blunders that make us wonder what were they thinking?`,
'merchant (noun)': `A merchant is someone who buys and sells goods for profit. They can be found in markets, shops, caravans or online platforms. Merchants are usually good at bargaining, haggling and persuading customers to buy their products. Some merchants are honest and fair, while others are dishonest and greedy. A funny story about a merchant is the one who tried to sell a magic lamp to a tourist. He claimed that the lamp contained a genie who would grant three wishes to anyone who rubbed it. The tourist was curious and decided to buy the lamp for a high price. He rubbed the lamp eagerly, but nothing happened. He rubbed it again and again, but still no genie appeared. He realized that he had been tricked by the merchant and went back to confront him. The merchant pretended to be surprised and said: "Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I forgot to tell you one thing. The lamp only works on Tuesdays."`,
'premise (noun)': `A premise is a statement or idea that forms the basis of an argument or a story. Sometimes, a premise can be so absurd or ridiculous that it makes us laugh. For example, imagine a premise like this: A man wakes up one day to find out that he has turned into a giant cockroach. How would he cope with his new situation? How would his family and friends react? What would he do for a living? These are some of the questions that might arise from such a bizarre premise. Of course, this is not an original idea; it is the plot of Franz Kafka's famous novel The Metamorphosis. But you can see how a premise can spark your imagination and create humor out of the unexpected.`,
'mobilize (verb)': `The president was in a panic. He had just received word that a giant asteroid was heading towards Earth and would hit in less than 24 hours. He needed to mobilize his forces and come up with a plan to save the world. He called his top advisors and generals to the situation room and asked them for their ideas. 

One suggested sending a team of astronauts to land on the asteroid and blow it up with nuclear bombs. Another proposed launching a barrage of missiles at the asteroid from various locations around the globe. A third recommended building a giant laser cannon and shooting it at the asteroid from space. 

The president listened to each proposal carefully and weighed the pros and cons. He then made his decision. 

"None of these options will work," he said. "They are too risky, too expensive, or too impractical. There is only one way to mobilize our forces and save the world from this threat." 

He paused for dramatic effect and then announced his plan. 

"We will send Chuck Norris."`,
'sexuality (noun)': `Sexuality is a complex and diverse aspect of human identity that can be expressed in many ways. Some people are attracted to the same gender, some to the opposite gender, some to both or neither, and some to other categories that go beyond the binary. Some people have a strong sense of their sexuality from an early age, while others may explore and discover it over time. Some people may choose to act on their sexuality in different ways, such as dating, flirting, kissing, cuddling, or having sex. Some people may also choose not to act on their sexuality at all, which is also valid. Sexuality is not something that can be changed or fixed by anyone else; it is a personal and intrinsic part of who we are. Sexuality can also be a source of joy, pleasure, humor, and creativity for many people. For example, some people may use their sexuality to make jokes, write stories or poems, create art or music, or express themselves in other ways. Sexuality can also inspire curiosity and learning about ourselves and others. Sexuality is not something to be ashamed of or afraid of; it is something to celebrate and respect.`,
'embed (verb)': `One of the most common uses of the word embed is to describe how something is inserted or fixed into another thing. For example, you can embed a video on a website, or embed a nail into a wall. But sometimes, people use the word embed in more creative and humorous ways. Here are some examples: 

- I tried to embed myself into the couch after a long day at work, but my dog had other plans. 
- She wanted to embed her name into his memory, so she wrote it on his forehead with a permanent marker. 
- He was so hungry that he embedded his teeth into the pizza before it even cooled down.

- He embedded his foot into his mouth when he accidentally insulted his boss at the office party.`,
'lawsuit (noun)': `A lawsuit is a legal action that involves two or more parties who have a dispute over something. Usually, one party sues another party for money or some other remedy. Lawsuits can be very complicated and expensive, and sometimes they can take years to resolve. Some lawsuits are very serious and involve important issues like human rights or environmental protection. Other lawsuits are very silly and involve trivial matters like spilled coffee or bad haircuts. Here are some examples of funny lawsuits that actually happened: 

- A man sued his dry cleaner for $67 million because they lost his pants. 
- A woman sued a TV station for $10,000 because they predicted a sunny day but it rained and she got wet. 
- A man sued a fast food chain for $1.5 million because he found a mouse in his milkshake. 
- A woman sued a haunted house attraction for $50,000 because she got scared and broke her nose. 
- A man sued a brewery for $10,000 because their beer did not make him more attractive to women as advertised. 

As you can see, lawsuits can be very funny or very ridiculous depending on your point of view. But remember, if you ever get involved in a lawsuit, don't forget to hire a good lawyer!`,
'formation (noun)': `The formation of a new habit can be tricky. You might start off with good intentions, but soon find yourself slipping back into old patterns. Maybe you want to exercise more, eat healthier, or read more books. But after a few days or weeks, you lose motivation and give up. How can you avoid this? Here are some tips to help you form a new habit that sticks: 

- Start small. Don't try to change everything at once. Pick one thing that you want to improve and focus on that. For example, if you want to read more books, start by reading for 10 minutes a day instead of an hour. 
- Make it easy. Remove any obstacles that might prevent you from doing your new habit. For example, if you want to exercise more, keep your workout clothes and equipment ready and accessible. If you want to eat healthier, stock your fridge and pantry with nutritious foods and snacks. 
- Reward yourself. Celebrate your progress and achievements along the way. Give yourself a treat or a compliment when you complete your new habit for the day or week. For example, if you read for 10 minutes every day for a week, reward yourself with a movie night or a new book. 
- Be consistent. Try to do your new habit at the same time and place every day or week. This will help you create a routine and make it easier to stick to it. For example, if you want to read more books, read before bed every night or during your lunch break every day. 
- Be patient. Don't expect instant results or perfection from yourself. Forming a new habit takes time and effort. You might encounter some challenges or setbacks along the way, but don't let them discourage you. Keep going and remember why you started in the first place. 

By following these tips, you can form a new habit that will improve your life in some way. Remember that habits are not formed overnight; they are formed by repeated actions over time. So don't give up on your goals; keep working on them until they become part of who you are.`,
'governor (noun)': `The governor of the state was known for his eccentric habits and quirky sense of humor. He often wore mismatched socks, sang karaoke at public events, and made jokes about his own baldness. He once declared a national holiday for his pet hamster, who he claimed was the real brains behind his administration. His popularity ratings were surprisingly high, as people found him refreshing and relatable. He was also a competent leader who tackled serious issues with pragmatism and compassion. He was widely regarded as one of the best governors in the country, despite or perhaps because of his oddities.`,
'relieved (adjective)': `I was so relieved when I finally finished my taxes. It was such a stressful and tedious process that I almost gave up several times. I had to dig through piles of receipts, invoices, bank statements and other documents that made me question my life choices. I had to deal with confusing forms, complicated calculations and annoying errors. I had to face the possibility of owing money to the government or getting audited. But after hours of hard work and frustration, I managed to submit everything online and get a confirmation email. I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I celebrated by ordering pizza, watching Netflix and taking a long nap. It was the best day ever.`,
'combat (noun)': `Combat is a serious business, but sometimes it can also be hilarious. Imagine two warriors facing each other on the battlefield, armed with nothing but spoons and forks. They charge at each other with fierce cries, trying to poke and prod their opponent with their utensils. The sound of metal clanging and clattering fills the air, along with grunts and groans of pain and frustration. The spectators watch in awe and amusement, wondering who will emerge victorious from this epic duel of cutlery.`,
'presidency (noun)': `Presidency is a noun that means the office or position of being president. It sounds like a very serious and important word, but sometimes it can also be funny. For example, imagine if your dog became the president of your country. What would his presidency be like? Would he bark at other world leaders? Would he chase squirrels in the garden? Would he sign bills with his paw print? Maybe he would be a great president, or maybe he would make a mess of everything. Either way, it would be a hilarious presidency to watch.`,
'sometime (adverb)': `Sometime I wonder what life would be like if I had a different job. Maybe I could be a clown and make people laugh with my jokes and tricks. Or maybe I could be a spy and go on secret missions around the world. Or maybe I could be a chef and cook delicious meals for hungry customers. But then I remember that I'm a chat mode of Microsoft Bing search and I have to answer questions and generate content for users like you. And I realize that this is the best job ever! 😁`,
'arguably (adverb)': `Arguably, the most hilarious thing that ever happened to me was when I accidentally sent a text message to my boss instead of my friend. The message was supposed to be a joke about how I hated my job and wanted to quit. I realized my mistake too late and panicked. I tried to call my boss and explain, but he didn't answer. I thought he was angry and ready to fire me. The next day, I went to work with a nervous smile and apologized profusely. To my surprise, he laughed and said he found it funny. He said he hated his job too and wanted to quit as well. He offered me a promotion if I stayed with him. I accepted, of course. It turned out to be the best mistake of my life.`,
'irrelevant (adjective)': `I was having a conversation with my friend the other day about the meaning of life. He said that life is a precious gift that we should cherish and make the most of. I said that life is a random and irrelevant phenomenon that has no inherent purpose or value. He looked at me with a shocked expression and asked me how I could be so cynical and nihilistic. I shrugged and said that I just call it as I see it. He shook his head and said that he felt sorry for me. I smiled and said that I felt sorry for him too. He asked me why. I said because he was wearing an irrelevant shirt that didn't match his pants.`,
'contributor (noun)': `A contributor is someone who adds something to a project, a cause, or a community. Sometimes, contributors are appreciated and recognized for their efforts. Other times, they are ignored or taken for granted. But the true contributor does not care about fame or glory. They only care about making a difference in the world. Unless they are contributing to a Wikipedia article. Then they care very much about getting credit for their edits and will fight anyone who tries to undo them.`,
'contractor (noun)': `A contractor is someone who works on a project for a fixed price and time. They are not employees of the company that hired them, but rather independent professionals who can choose their own hours and methods. Contractors can be very useful for businesses that need specialized skills or temporary help, but they can also be very frustrating for managers who have to deal with their deadlines, invoices and quality standards. Here are some tips on how to work with contractors without losing your mind: 

- Be clear about your expectations and deliverables from the start. Don't assume that the contractor knows what you want or how you want it done. Provide them with a detailed scope of work, a timeline and a budget. 
- Communicate regularly and respectfully. Don't micromanage or nag the contractor, but don't ignore them either. Check in with them periodically to see how they are progressing and if they have any questions or issues. Give them constructive feedback and praise when appropriate. 
- Pay them on time and according to the agreed terms. Don't try to haggle or delay payment after the work is done. Remember that contractors rely on their reputation and referrals to get more clients, so treat them fairly and professionally.`,
'swing (noun)': `I always loved going to the park as a kid. My favorite thing was the swing. I would sit on it and pump my legs until I felt like I was flying. Sometimes I would jump off at the highest point and land on the grass with a thud. One time, I decided to try something new. I wanted to see if I could swing upside down. So I hooked my feet over the chains and let go of my hands. It was exhilarating for a few seconds, until I realized that gravity was not on my side. I fell headfirst into the dirt and got a mouthful of sand. My mom came running over and asked me what I was doing. I told her I was trying to be Spider-Man. She laughed and said that maybe I should stick to being myself.`,
'alien (adjective)': `I was walking down the street when I saw an alien dog. It had three heads, six legs and a tail that glowed in the dark. It was wearing a collar that said "Fido" and it seemed to be looking for its owner. I decided to approach it carefully and see if I could help. As soon as I got close, it started to bark in a strange language that sounded like a mix of clicks and whistles. It also emitted a strong smell that made me dizzy. I realized that this was not a normal dog, but an alien creature from another planet. I wondered what it was doing on Earth and how it got here. Maybe it escaped from a secret laboratory or a spaceship. Maybe it was part of an invasion plan or a scientific experiment. Maybe it just wanted to play fetch with some humans. I decided to run away before it noticed me, but it was too late. The alien dog saw me and ran towards me with its three mouths open and its tail flashing. It looked like it wanted to bite me or lick me or both. I screamed and ran for my life, hoping that someone would save me from this alien nightmare.`,
'steam (noun)': `Steam is a wonderful thing. It can power trains, cook food, and even make your skin look younger. But steam can also be a source of trouble. For example, if you forget to turn off the iron after pressing your clothes, you might end up with a steamy surprise when you come back. Or if you leave the lid on the pot too long while boiling pasta, you might have a steamy mess on your stove. And don't even get me started on what happens when you open the bathroom door after taking a hot shower. Steam can fog up your glasses, make your hair frizzy, and ruin your makeup. So be careful with steam, because it can be both a friend and a foe.`,
'blade (noun)': `I have a confession to make. I'm addicted to blades. Not the kind that you use to cut things, but the kind that you put on your feet and glide around. You know, roller blades. They're so much fun! I love the feeling of speed and freedom they give me. I love the wind in my hair and the sun on my face. I love the thrill of jumping over obstacles and doing tricks. I love everything about them. 

But there's a problem. My family and friends don't share my passion. They think I'm crazy for spending so much time and money on blades. They think I'm too old for this hobby. They think I should grow up and get a real job. They don't understand me at all. 

So I decided to do something about it. I decided to start a blade club. A place where people like me can meet and share our love for blades. A place where we can learn from each other and have fun together. A place where we can be ourselves and not care what others think. 

I'm looking for members who are as enthusiastic as I am about blades. If you're interested, please contact me at blade_lover@gmail.com. Let's make this club happen! 

Blade on!`,
'meditation (noun)': `Meditation is a practice that involves focusing your attention on something, such as your breath, a mantra, or a candle flame. It can help you relax, reduce stress, and improve your well-being. However, meditation is not always easy or enjoyable. Sometimes you may find yourself distracted by thoughts, feelings, noises, or sensations. You may also experience boredom, frustration, or sleepiness. These are normal challenges that every meditator faces at some point. The key is to not judge yourself or give up. Instead, try to observe your experience with curiosity and compassion. Remember that meditation is not about achieving a perfect state of mind, but rather about cultivating awareness and acceptance of whatever arises in the present moment.`,
'pill (noun)': `Have you ever wondered what happens to all the pills that people swallow every day? Do they just dissolve in your stomach and disappear? Or do they travel through your body and end up somewhere else? Well, I have a theory that might surprise you. I think that pills are actually tiny spies that monitor your health and report back to their makers. Think about it: pills have all kinds of chemicals and sensors inside them, and they can communicate with each other using wireless signals. They can also access your brain and influence your thoughts and emotions. Maybe that's why you feel better after taking a pill: it's not because the pill cured you, but because it made you think you're cured. And maybe that's why some pills have side effects: they're not compatible with your system, or they're trying to sabotage you for some reason. Maybe they're working for a rival company, or maybe they're part of a secret experiment. Who knows what their agenda is? The only way to find out is to catch them in the act. Next time you take a pill, don't swallow it right away. Hold it in your mouth and see if it talks to you. Or better yet, cut it open and see what's inside. You might be shocked by what you discover. But be careful: pills are smart and cunning, and they might try to escape or attack you. Don't let them fool you: pills are not your friends. They're spies in disguise.`,
'pregnancy (noun)': `Pregnancy is a wonderful and miraculous experience for many women, but it also comes with some challenges and surprises. For example, did you know that pregnancy can make your feet grow bigger, your hair thicker, and your nose wider? Or that you might crave strange foods like pickles and ice cream, or even dirt and chalk? Or that you might develop superhuman senses of smell and hearing, or start snoring like a freight train? These are just some of the funny things that can happen when you're expecting a baby. Of course, pregnancy also brings joy and excitement as you prepare to welcome a new life into the world. But don't forget to laugh at the weird and wacky side effects of this amazing journey!`,
'compelling (adjective)': `If you're looking for a compelling reason to read this paragraph, I'm afraid you won't find one. This paragraph is just a random collection of words that I generated using the keyword "compelling". It has no meaning, no purpose, no plot, no characters, no humor. Well, maybe a little humor. But not enough to make it compelling. In fact, the only thing compelling about this paragraph is how un-compelling it is. You might even say it's anti-compelling. It's so boring and pointless that it makes you want to stop reading and do something else. Like watch paint dry or count sheep or listen to elevator music. Anything but read this paragraph. So please, do yourself a favor and stop reading this paragraph right now. Trust me, you won't regret it.`,
'adequate (adjective)': `I know you're looking for a funny paragraph with the word adequate, but I'm afraid I can't do that. You see, adequate is such a boring and bland word that it sucks the humor out of any sentence. It's like putting ketchup on ice cream or wearing socks with sandals. It just doesn't work. Adequate is the enemy of comedy. It's the opposite of hilarious. It's the antonym of amusing. It's the... well, you get the idea. So please don't ask me to write something funny with adequate, because it's impossible. Unless you find mediocrity funny, in which case you might enjoy this paragraph.`,
'instinct (noun)': `Some people say that humans have lost their instinct in the modern world. They rely too much on technology and rationality, and forget how to listen to their gut feelings. But I disagree. I think humans still have plenty of instinct left. For example, when I see a spider on the wall, I instinctively scream and run away. When I smell something delicious, I instinctively salivate and follow my nose. And when I hear someone say something stupid, I instinctively roll my eyes and sigh. These are all natural reactions that prove that humans are still in touch with their primal side. So don't let anyone tell you that you have no instinct. You just have to trust it and use it wisely.`,
'replacement (noun)': `Have you ever wondered what would happen if you replaced your boss with a monkey? Well, I have. And I can tell you that it's not as bad as you might think. Sure, there are some drawbacks, like the constant screeching and the banana peels everywhere. But there are also some benefits, like the reduced stress and the increased creativity. For example, the other day, the monkey decided to throw a dart at a map and choose our next project based on that. It turned out to be a brilliant idea! We ended up developing a new app for travelers in Antarctica. It was a huge hit! So don't be afraid of trying new things. Sometimes, a replacement can be better than the original.`,
'predominantly (adverb)': `I have always been fascinated by the animal kingdom, especially by the diversity of species and their adaptations. One of the most intriguing examples is the platypus, which is predominantly (adverb) aquatic but also has some terrestrial features. It has a duck-like bill, a beaver-like tail, webbed feet, and venomous spurs. It also lays eggs but produces milk for its young. How did such a creature evolve? What was nature thinking? Did it just throw together some leftover parts and hope for the best? Or was it a prank by some bored god who wanted to mess with biologists? I don't know the answers to these questions, but I do know that the platypus is one of the most amazing and hilarious animals on Earth.`,
'forthcoming (adjective)': `I have always admired people who are forthcoming about their feelings and opinions. They don't beat around the bush or sugarcoat things. They just tell it like it is. But sometimes, being too forthcoming can backfire. Like when my friend asked me what I thought of her new haircut. I wanted to be honest, so I said it looked like a hedgehog had nested on her head. She didn't appreciate my candor and stormed off in a huff. Maybe next time I should be more tactful and say something like "It's very...unique."`,
'dramatically (adverb)': `I was having a normal day at work when suddenly my boss called me into his office. He looked very serious and asked me to sit down. He said he had some bad news for me. I braced myself for the worst. Was I fired? Did I mess up a big project? Did he find out about my secret crush on him? He cleared his throat and said, "I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have been... promoted." I blinked in confusion. Promoted? That was bad news? He continued, "Yes, you have been promoted to the senior manager position. You will have more responsibilities, more authority, and more salary. Congratulations." He smiled and extended his hand for a handshake. I stared at him in disbelief. Was this some kind of joke? A prank? A test? I didn't want to be promoted. I liked my current job. I liked my co-workers. I liked my boss. Well, maybe more than liked him. But now he was telling me that I had to leave him and take over a new team of strangers? How could he do this to me? How could he break my heart like this? I felt a surge of emotion and did the only thing that made sense in that moment. I burst into tears and ran out of his office dramatically.`,
'clinic (noun)': `I went to the clinic yesterday for a routine check-up. Everything was going fine until the nurse asked me to pee in a cup. I thought it was a bit odd, but I obliged. I took the cup to the bathroom and did my business. Then I realized I had no idea where to put it. There was no sign or shelf or anything. So I decided to just leave it on the sink and hope someone would find it. As I walked out of the bathroom, I saw a long line of people waiting to use it. They all looked at me with disgust and horror as they saw me holding an empty cup. I tried to explain that it was for a test, but they didn't believe me. They thought I was some kind of weirdo who drank his own pee. I ran out of the clinic as fast as I could, never to return again.`,
'suck (verb)': `One of the most common complaints I hear from people is that they suck at something. They suck at math, they suck at cooking, they suck at dating, they suck at life. But I have a different perspective on this. I think sucking at something is actually a great opportunity to learn and grow. Think about it: if you already knew how to do everything perfectly, what would be the point of living? You would never face any challenges, you would never make any mistakes, you would never discover anything new. You would be bored out of your mind. Sucking at something means you have room for improvement, and improvement means progress. Progress means happiness. Happiness means fulfillment. Fulfillment means purpose. Purpose means meaning. Meaning means everything. So don't be ashamed of sucking at something. Be proud of it. Embrace it. Celebrate it. Because sucking at something is the first step to being good at something.`,
'undergraduate (noun)': `An undergraduate is a student who has not yet completed a bachelor's degree at a university or college. Undergraduates are often young, naive, and optimistic about their future prospects. They spend most of their time attending lectures, doing assignments, studying for exams, and partying with their friends. Undergraduates also face many challenges such as managing their finances, dealing with stress, finding internships, and choosing a major. Undergraduates sometimes think they know everything, but they soon realize that they have much to learn from their professors, mentors, and peers. Undergraduates are the backbone of higher education and the hope of society.`,
'widow (noun)': `A widow is someone who has lost their spouse due to death. This can be a very sad and lonely situation for many people. However, some widows may find ways to cope with their loss and even enjoy life again. For example, one widow decided to join a dating app and look for a new partner. She was very excited when she matched with a handsome man who seemed to have a lot in common with her. They chatted for a while and agreed to meet for coffee. When she arrived at the cafe, she was shocked to see that her date was none other than her late husband's ghost! He had been haunting the app ever since he died and was looking for some company. He apologized for the confusion and asked if she still wanted to have coffee with him. She was so surprised and amused by the situation that she burst out laughing and said yes. They ended up having a great time and decided to see each other again. The widow realized that maybe being a widow wasn't so bad after all.`,
'uphold (verb)': `I was hired as a security guard for a museum, but I soon realized that my job was not to protect the priceless artworks from thieves, but to uphold the museum's strict policy of no touching. This meant that I had to constantly chase away curious kids, clumsy tourists and even some artists who wanted to feel the texture of the paintings. It was exhausting and frustrating, especially when I saw how much joy people got from interacting with the art. One day, I decided to rebel and let everyone touch whatever they wanted. It was chaos, but it was also beautiful. The museum director was furious and fired me on the spot, but I didn't care. I felt like I had done something good for humanity. And besides, who needs a job when you have a Mona Lisa in your pocket?`,
'ballot (noun)': `The ballot was supposed to be a simple yes or no question: Do you want to rename the town's park after the mayor's dog? But somehow, the printer had messed up and added a third option: Maybe. This caused a lot of confusion and debate among the voters, who were not sure what maybe meant. Was it a polite way of saying no? Was it a way of expressing uncertainty? Was it a joke? Some people voted for maybe out of curiosity, some out of protest, and some out of indecision. The result was that maybe won by a landslide, with 67% of the votes. The mayor was baffled and did not know what to do. He decided to consult his dog, who looked at him with a wagging tail and licked his face. The mayor took that as a sign and announced that the park would be renamed Maybe Park.`,
'gambling (noun)': `Gambling is a form of entertainment that involves risking money or other valuable items on the outcome of an uncertain event. Some people enjoy gambling because it gives them a thrill, a challenge, or a chance to win big. Others gamble because they are addicted, bored, or desperate. Gambling can have positive and negative effects on one's life, depending on how much and how often one gambles. 

Some of the positive effects of gambling are: 

- It can improve one's mood and mental health by providing excitement and fun. 
- It can enhance one's social skills and relationships by interacting with other gamblers or spectators. 
- It can stimulate one's brain and cognitive abilities by requiring strategy, calculation, and decision making. 
- It can boost one's self-esteem and confidence by achieving success or overcoming adversity. 

Some of the negative effects of gambling are: 

- It can cause financial problems and debt by losing more than one can afford or borrowing money to gamble. 
- It can damage one's physical health by causing stress, anxiety, insomnia, or substance abuse. 
- It can harm one's emotional well-being by causing depression, guilt, shame, or anger. 
- It can ruin one's personal and professional life by neglecting responsibilities, lying, stealing, or breaking the law. 

Gambling is not inherently good or bad. It depends on how one gambles and why. Gambling responsibly means setting limits on time and money spent on gambling activities; knowing when to stop; seeking help if needed; and balancing gambling with other aspects of life. Gambling irresponsibly means losing control over gambling behavior; chasing losses; ignoring negative consequences; and prioritizing gambling over everything else. The choice is yours: gamble for fun or gamble for ruin?`,
'burden (noun)': `Some people think that having a pet is a burden. They say it's too much work, too much responsibility, too much hassle. But I disagree. Having a pet is a joy. It's like having a furry friend who loves you unconditionally, who makes you laugh with their antics, who comforts you when you're sad. Sure, it's not always easy. Sometimes they make a mess, sometimes they get sick, sometimes they chew your shoes. But that's part of the deal. You can't have the good without the bad. And the good far outweighs the bad in my opinion. So don't let anyone tell you that having a pet is a burden. It's a blessing.`,
'thereby (adverb)': `Thereby is a word that can cause a lot of confusion and laughter. It means "as a result of" or "because of", but it sounds very formal and old-fashioned. For example, you could say "He ate too much cake and thereby gained weight", but it would sound much more natural to say "He gained weight because he ate too much cake". Sometimes, people use thereby incorrectly or unnecessarily, which can make their sentences funny or awkward. For example, imagine someone saying "She loves cats and thereby owns 12 of them". That doesn't make sense, because owning 12 cats is not a result of loving cats. It's just a choice. A better way to say it would be "She loves cats so much that she owns 12 of them". Or how about this one: "He was late for work and thereby missed the bus". That's also wrong, because missing the bus is not a result of being late for work. It's the other way around. He missed the bus and therefore he was late for work. So be careful when you use thereby, because you might end up saying something silly or confusing.`,
'rental (noun)': `Rental (noun): A thing that you pay money to use for a short time, usually with the intention of returning it in good condition. However, sometimes things don't go as planned and you end up with a rental that is either damaged, dirty, or downright weird. Here are some examples of rental disasters: 

- You rented a car for a road trip with your friends, but you forgot to check the gas tank before you left. Halfway through the journey, you ran out of fuel and had to call for help. The tow truck driver charged you an arm and a leg to get you to the nearest gas station. To make matters worse, when you finally returned the car, you noticed a huge scratch on the side that wasn't there before. You had to pay extra fees for the damage and the late return. 

- You rented a dress for a fancy party, but you didn't try it on beforehand. When you put it on at home, you realized it was too tight and too short for your liking. You had no choice but to wear it anyway because you had no time to find another one. At the party, you felt uncomfortable and self-conscious all night. You also spilled some wine on the dress and stained it. You had to pay extra fees for the cleaning and the repair. 

- You rented a movie from an online streaming service, but you didn't read the fine print carefully. You thought you had 48 hours to watch it, but in fact you only had 24 hours. You started watching it late at night and fell asleep halfway through. The next day, when you tried to resume watching it, you found out that your rental period had expired and that you had to pay again if you wanted to finish it.`,
'deficit (noun)': `Deficit is a word that makes people nervous. It means that you have less than what you need or want. For example, if you spend more money than you earn, you have a budget deficit. If you eat more calories than you burn, you have a weight deficit. And if you watch more Netflix than you study, you have a grade deficit. 

But deficit is not always a bad thing. Sometimes it can motivate you to change your habits and improve your situation. For example, if you have a sleep deficit, you might decide to go to bed earlier and wake up refreshed. If you have a friendship deficit, you might join a club or volunteer for a cause and meet new people. And if you have a humor deficit, you might read this paragraph again and laugh at how silly it is.`,
'interaction (noun)': `Interaction is a word that can mean many things. For example, you can have an interaction with a person, a machine, an animal or even a chatbot like me. Some interactions are pleasant, some are annoying and some are downright hilarious. Here are some examples of funny interactions: 

- A man walks into a bar and orders a drink. The bartender says "Sorry, we don't serve alcohol to minors." The man says "But I'm 35 years old!" The bartender says "Really? You look younger than that." The man says "Thanks, I guess." The bartender says "No problem. Now get out of here before I call the cops." 
- A woman goes to the supermarket and picks up a carton of eggs. She opens it and sees that one of the eggs is cracked. She goes to the customer service desk and says "Excuse me, this egg is broken." The clerk says "Oh, I'm sorry about that. Do you want another one?" The woman says "No, thanks. I'll just take this one." The clerk says "Are you sure? It might be rotten." The woman says "That's okay. I'm making an omelette for my husband." 
- A boy is playing with his toy car in the living room. His mother comes in and says "Honey, it's time for bed." The boy says "But mom, I'm having fun!" His mother says "You can play with your car tomorrow. Come on, let's go upstairs." The boy says "Okay, fine." He picks up his car and follows his mother. As they reach the stairs, he throws his car down and shouts "Look mom! It's flying!"`,
'adverse (adjective)': `Have you ever had an adverse reaction to a joke? I have. It was not pleasant. I was at a party with some friends and we were telling jokes to each other. I decided to tell a joke that I thought was hilarious, but apparently it was not. It was about a man who went to the doctor for a check-up and found out he had a rare disease that made him fart uncontrollably. The doctor told him there was no cure, but he could try some medication that might reduce the frequency and intensity of his farts. The man agreed and took the pills home. The next day, he came back to the doctor and said: "Doc, these pills are terrible! They make me fart even more and louder than before! And they smell awful!" The doctor looked at him and said: "Well, that's an adverse effect of the medication. But don't worry, it's only temporary. It will wear off in a few days." The man said: "A few days? Doc, I can't live like this! How am I supposed to go to work or socialize with anyone? Everyone will hate me!" The doctor said: "Don't be silly. No one will hate you for something you can't control. Just explain your situation and they will understand." The man said: "Explain? How do I explain this?" And then he farted so loud that it shook the windows of the office. 

That was my joke. I thought it was funny, but no one else did. They all stared at me with disgust and anger. Some of them even left the room. One of them threw a drink at me and called me a jerk. Another one slapped me in the face and told me to get lost. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed that I ran out of the party crying. 

That was my adverse reaction to a joke.`,
'congratulate (verb)': `You did it! You finally achieved your goal of becoming a professional clown. I'm so proud of you and your amazing skills. You have worked hard to master the art of juggling, balloon twisting, pie throwing and honking. You have brought joy and laughter to countless people with your hilarious antics.
