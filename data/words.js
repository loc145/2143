`The Last Day

She knew it was her last day on Earth. She had seen the news, heard the warnings, felt the tremors. The asteroid was coming, and nothing could stop it. She had no family, no friends, no one to say goodbye to. She had lived a lonely life, working as a librarian in a small town. She loved books, but she never found anyone who shared her passion.

She decided to spend her last day doing what she loved most: reading. She went to the library, picked a book from the shelf, and sat down in a cozy corner. She opened the book and began to read. She was transported to another world, a world of magic and adventure, of heroes and villains, of love and loss. She forgot about the impending doom, about the chaos outside, about her own insignificance. She was immersed in the story, feeling every emotion, every twist, every turn.

She reached the last page, and closed the book. She smiled, feeling a sense of satisfaction and peace. She had lived a thousand lives through the books she read. She had experienced more than most people ever would. She had encompassed the whole spectrum of human existence, from joy to sorrow, from hope to despair, from birth to death.

She looked at the clock. It was almost time. She got up from her seat, and walked to the exit. She stepped outside, and looked up at the sky. She saw a bright flash, followed by a loud boom. She felt a wave of heat and pressure, then nothing at all.`,

`The Scratch

She had always hated her name. Scratch. It sounded like something you did to an itch, not a person. She wondered why her parents had chosen it, and if they had ever regretted it.

She had grown up with teasing and bullying, with people making jokes about her name and scratching their arms or legs whenever they saw her. She had learned to ignore them, to pretend she didn’t care, but inside she felt hurt and angry.

She had dreamed of changing her name, of becoming someone else, someone normal. But she never had the courage or the money to do it. She felt stuck with her name, with her identity, with her life.

She worked as a waitress at a diner, serving coffee and pancakes to customers who barely noticed her. She lived in a small apartment with a cat named Fluffy, who scratched her furniture and her face. She had no friends, no hobbies, no goals.

“I like it. It’s unique. It suits you.”

“Thank you,” she said softly.

He asked her about herself, and she told him some things she had never told anyone before. She told him how she hated her name, how she felt lonely and bored, how she wished she could do something different with her life.

He listened attentively, nodding and smiling. He didn’t judge her or pity her. He understood her.

She worked hard to achieve her goal, studying at the best universities and publishing her research in prestigious journals.

One day, she received an email from an old colleague. He claimed to have found a hidden map that revealed the location of a lost Templar treasure. He said he needed her help to decipher it and asked her to join him on a secret mission. He said it was too dangerous to explain more online and that he would send her a plane ticket and a fake passport.

She was skeptical at first, but also curious. She wondered if it was a hoax or a trap. She wondered if it was worth risking her life for a treasure that might not even exist. She wondered if she still had the courage and the passion to be a historian.

One day, she decided to paint a rainbow on her bedroom wall. She took out her crayons and started to draw a big arc of red. Then she added orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. She was very proud of her work. She stepped back to admire it.

But something was wrong. The rainbow looked dull and faded on the wall. It did not shine like the ones she saw in the sky after a rainstorm. It did not make her feel happy and hopeful. It made her feel sad and disappointed.

She wondered why her rainbow was so different from the real ones. She decided to ask her mother.

“Mommy, why is my rainbow so ugly?” she asked.

Her mother looked at the wall and smiled.

“Your rainbow is not ugly, sweetheart. It’s very pretty. But it’s not the same as the ones in the sky because they are made of light.”

“Light?” Lila asked.

“Yes, light. When sunlight passes through raindrops, it splits into different colors. That’s how rainbows originate. They are like a gift from nature to cheer us up after a storm.”

Lila thought about what her mother said. She wanted to see a real rainbow again. She wished it would rain soon.

The next day, it did rain. Lila watched the raindrops fall from her window. She hoped they would make a rainbow for her.

When the rain stopped, she ran outside with her mother. She looked up at the sky and gasped.

There it was. A bright and beautiful rainbow that stretched across the horizon. It was red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It shone like a jewel in the sky.

Lila smiled and pointed at it.

“Look, Mommy! A rainbow! It’s so pretty!”

Her mother hugged her and said,

“Yes, it is. And do you know what? You helped make it.”

“I did?” Lila asked.

“Yes, you did. Because every time you paint a rainbow with your crayons, you are creating something wonderful in your mind. And your mind is like a light that can shine through anything. Even raindrops.”

Lila felt a warm glow in her heart. She realized that she had something in common with the rainbow.

She was also made of light.`,

Anna had always dreamed of living in a socialist country. She hated the inequality and injustice of capitalism, where the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. She wanted to be part of a society where everyone had equal rights and opportunities, where people shared their wealth and resources, where health care and education were free and universal, where workers had a say in their workplaces, where democracy and solidarity prevailed.

She was thrilled when she got accepted to study abroad in a small European nation that claimed to be socialist. She packed her bags and boarded the plane, eager to experience her ideal society.

But when she arrived, she was shocked by what she saw. The streets were dirty and crowded, the buildings were old and crumbling, the people were unhappy and unfriendly. She learned that the government controlled everything, from the media to the economy, from the courts to the schools. There was no freedom of speech or expression, no diversity of opinion or culture, no civil rights or human rights. The people lived in fear of the secret police, who could arrest anyone for any reason. The workers had no power or voice, they were exploited and oppressed by the state-owned enterprises. The health care and education systems were underfunded and inefficient, the quality of life was low and the poverty rate was high.

Anna realized that this was not socialism, but a dictatorship that used socialism as a cover for its corruption and tyranny. She felt betrayed and disillusioned. She wanted to leave as soon as possible, but she had no money or passport. She was trapped in a nightmare.

She wondered if there was any place in the world where socialism really worked, where people lived in harmony and prosperity, where her dream could come true.

There once was a fisherman who loved to exaggerate his catches. He would tell his friends and family that he had caught the biggest, the fastest, and the most beautiful fish in the sea. He would boast about how he had fought with sharks, dolphins, and even giant squids. He would make up stories about his adventures and dangers on the water.

One day, he decided to go fishing in a new spot, far away from the shore. He hoped to find some rare and exotic fish that he could brag about later. He sailed his boat for hours, until he reached a calm and deep part of the ocean. He threw his line into the water and waited patiently.

Suddenly, he felt a strong tug on his line. He pulled hard, thinking he had hooked a huge fish. But to his surprise and horror, he saw a massive whale emerge from the water. The whale was angry and confused, and it started to thrash and splash around. The fisherman realized he had accidentally caught the whale by its tail.

He tried to free the whale, but it was too late. The whale dragged him and his boat across the ocean, faster than any wind or wave. The fisherman screamed and prayed, but no one could hear him or help him. He wished he had never lied about his catches, and he regretted his foolishness.

The whale finally stopped at a small island, where it shook off the fisherman and his boat. The fisherman was lucky to be alive, but he was stranded on the island with no food, water, or shelter. He looked around and saw nothing but sand, rocks, and palm trees.

He wondered how long he would survive on the island, and how he would ever get back home. He wished he could tell someone what had happened to him, but he knew no one would believe him. He realized that his exaggeration had become his punishment.`,

'myth (noun)':
`The Myth of the Moon

Lila always loved the moon. She would gaze at it every night from her window, wondering what secrets it hid. She had heard many stories about the moon, but none of them satisfied her curiosity. She wanted to see it for herself.

One night, she decided to sneak out of her house and go to the forest. She had heard that there was a hidden path that led to the moon. She packed a flashlight, a sandwich, and a bottle of water. She put on her warmest coat and boots. She was ready for an adventure.

She walked through the dark streets until she reached the edge of the forest. She turned on her flashlight and looked for the path. She found it after a few minutes of searching. It was narrow and overgrown with vines and branches. She followed it deeper into the woods.

She walked for a long time, but she didn't see any sign of the moon. She started to doubt if the path was real or just a myth. She was about to give up when she saw a faint glow ahead. She quickened her pace and reached a clearing.

There, in the middle of the clearing, was a huge silver sphere. It was the moon. It was so close that she could touch it. She ran towards it, filled with wonder and joy.

She reached out her hand and touched the surface of the moon. It was cold and smooth. She felt a strange sensation in her fingers. She looked at them and saw that they were turning silver. She gasped and pulled back her hand.

She realized too late that it was a trap. The moon was not a friendly place. It was a hungry creature that lured people with its beauty and then consumed them. She tried to run away, but it was too late. The moon had wrapped its tendrils around her legs and pulled her closer.

She screamed, but no one heard her. The forest was silent. The moon swallowed her whole and then returned to its normal shape. It looked innocent and peaceful again.

It waited for its next victim.

She had always been fascinated by light. How it could bend, reflect, refract, and create beautiful patterns. She loved to play with prisms, lenses, mirrors, and lasers. She wanted to be an optical engineer when she grew up.

One day, she found a strange device in her grandfather’s attic. It looked like a metal box with a dial and a button. There was a label that said “Incidence Adjuster”. She was curious and decided to try it out.

She pointed the device at a wall and pressed the button. A beam of light came out of the box and hit the wall at a right angle. She turned the dial and noticed that the angle of incidence changed. The beam moved along the wall, creating different shapes and shadows.

She was amazed and delighted. She wondered what would happen if she pointed the device at something else. She aimed it at a mirror and pressed the button. The beam bounced off the mirror and hit another wall. She turned the dial again and saw that the angle of reflection changed as well.

She was having so much fun that she didn’t notice her grandfather coming up the stairs. He saw her playing with the device and gasped.

`The Raid

They had been planning the raid for weeks. They knew the risks, but they also knew the rewards. They had studied the layout of the museum, memorized the security codes, and prepared their disguises. They had everything they needed to pull off the heist of the century.

They arrived at the museum at midnight, wearing black suits and masks. They cut the power and disabled the alarms. They moved swiftly and silently through the dark corridors, avoiding the cameras and guards. They reached their target: a priceless painting by Van Gogh.

They carefully removed the painting from the wall and placed it in a padded case. They were about to make their escape when they heard a loud siren. They had been betrayed.

They ran towards the exit, but it was too late. The police had surrounded the building. They had no choice but to surrender.

They were handcuffed and escorted to a police van. They looked at each other with anger and disappointment. They had failed.

But as they were driven away, they noticed something odd. The painting in the case was not Van Gogh's masterpiece. It was a cheap replica.

They realized they had been duped. Someone had switched the paintings before they got there. Someone had raided them.

---
Q: Who do you think switched the paintings?

A: That’s a good question. I don’t know for sure, but I can imagine a few possibilities. Maybe it was the museum curator, who wanted to protect the original painting from being stolen. Maybe it was another thief, who had access to the museum and wanted to sell the painting for themselves. Maybe it was a prankster, who wanted to fool the robbers and make them look foolish. What do you think?`,

'ruin (verb)':
`The Last Straw

She had always been patient with him. She had endured his lies, his cheating, his drinking, his gambling. She had hoped he would change, that he would see how much she loved him and how much he was hurting her. But he never did.

She had given him one last chance. She had told him that if he ever betrayed her again, she would leave him for good. He had promised her that he would be faithful, that he would quit his vices, that he would treat her better. She had believed him.

But then she found out. She found out that he had been seeing another woman behind her back. She found out that he had spent all their savings on a trip to Vegas. She found out that he had lied to her about everything.

She was furious. She was heartbroken. She was done.

She packed her bags and left him a note on the kitchen table. It read:

“I’m leaving you. You have ruined our marriage, you have ruined our lives, you have ruined me. Don’t try to find me. Don’t try to call me. Don’t try to apologize. It’s too late. You have lost me forever.”

She took the car and drove away. She didn’t look back.

He came home late that night. He was drunk and happy. He had won big at the casino. He had bought a necklace for his mistress. He had forgotten about his wife.

He saw the note on the table. He read it with disbelief. He felt a pang of guilt, a twinge of regret, a flash of anger.

He crumpled the note and threw it in the trash. He shrugged and went to bed.

He didn’t care.`,

'dive (noun)':
`The Dive

She had always wanted to try scuba diving, ever since she was a little girl. She loved the ocean, the colors, the creatures, the mystery. She dreamed of exploring the underwater world, of feeling free and weightless.

But she was also afraid. Afraid of the dark depths, the unknown dangers, the pressure on her lungs. She had heard stories of divers who got lost, injured, or worse. She wondered if she had what it took to face her fears and dive into the blue.

She decided to sign up for a beginner's course at a local dive center. She learned the basics of diving theory, equipment, and safety. She practiced in a pool with an instructor, who taught her how to breathe, move, and communicate underwater. She felt nervous but excited.

The day of her first open water dive arrived. She boarded a boat with her instructor and a few other students. They sailed to a nearby reef, where the water was clear and calm. She put on her gear and checked everything twice. She listened to the final briefing and nodded.

She sat on the edge of the boat and looked down. She saw the sun rays dancing on the surface, the coral formations below, the fish swimming by. She took a deep breath and gave the OK sign to her instructor.

She rolled backwards and plunged into the water. She felt a splash, then a silence. She opened her eyes and saw a new world. She felt a surge of wonder and joy.

She followed her instructor and descended slowly. She equalized her ears and checked her depth gauge. She was 10 meters deep and still going down.

She looked around and marveled at the beauty and diversity of life. She saw colorful corals, anemones, sponges, starfish. She saw schools of fish, big and small, darting and swirling. She saw a turtle, a ray, a shark.

She felt no fear, only awe. She felt like she belonged there, like she was part of the ocean. She smiled behind her mask and thought: this is it. This is my dive.`,

'so-called (adjective)':
`The So-Called Hero

He was hailed as a hero, but he knew he didn’t deserve it. He had only done what anyone else would have done in his place. He had pulled a child out of a burning car, risking his own life in the process. He had acted on instinct, not courage.

But the media didn’t care about the truth. They wanted a story, and he was their perfect protagonist. They praised his bravery, his selflessness, his heroism. They interviewed him on TV, put his picture on the front page, gave him awards and honors. They made him a celebrity overnight.

He hated it. He hated the attention, the fame, the lies. He hated how everyone looked at him with admiration and gratitude, when he felt nothing but guilt and shame. He hated how they called him a hero, when he knew he was a fraud.

He tried to tell them the truth, but they wouldn’t listen. They dismissed his modesty as humility, his honesty as false modesty. They told him he was being too hard on himself, that he should be proud of what he had done, that he had saved a life.

But he knew he hadn’t saved a life. He had only delayed a death. The child he had rescued had suffered severe burns and internal injuries. He had been taken to the hospital, where he had undergone multiple surgeries and treatments. He had been in a coma for weeks, with little hope of recovery.

He visited him every day, hoping for a miracle, praying for forgiveness. He blamed himself for the child’s condition, for not being faster, for not being smarter, for not being better. He wished he could trade places with him, give him his life, his health, his happiness.

He wished he could die instead of him.

But he couldn’t. He had to live with his guilt, his pain, his so-called heroism.

He had to live with being a so-called hero.`,

'premier (adjective)':
`The Premier Painting

Anna had always dreamed of seeing the Mona Lisa in person. She had read countless books and articles about the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, and she was fascinated by its history, mystery, and beauty. She had saved up for years to afford a trip to Paris, where the painting was displayed at the Louvre Museum.

She arrived at the museum early in the morning, hoping to avoid the crowds. She followed the signs to the gallery where the Mona Lisa was located, and felt her heart beat faster as she approached. She expected to see a large, magnificent painting that would take her breath away.

But when she finally reached the spot, she was disappointed. The painting was much smaller than she had imagined, and it was protected by a thick glass and a metal barrier. There were dozens of people around it, taking pictures with their phones and cameras. She could barely see the painting from where she stood, and she felt a surge of frustration.

She waited patiently for her turn to get closer, but it seemed like everyone else was taking forever. She wondered if it was worth it, if she had wasted her time and money for this. She almost gave up and left, but then she saw a small opening in the crowd. She quickly squeezed through and reached the front row.

She looked at the painting and felt a shock of recognition. She had seen this face before, many times, in her own mirror. The woman in the painting looked exactly like her. She had the same brown hair, the same green eyes, the same faint smile. She felt a chill run down her spine as she stared into her own eyes.

She heard someone behind her say, “Excuse me, miss, can you please move? I want to see the painting.” She turned around and saw a man holding a camera. He looked annoyed and impatient.

She said, “Sorry, I was just…” She stopped when she saw his face. He looked exactly like Leonardo da Vinci. He had the same long beard, the same piercing eyes, the same artistic expression.

He said, “What are you doing here? You’re not supposed to be here. You’re supposed to be in my studio.”

He grabbed her hand and pulled her away from the crowd. He said, “Come with me. I have something to show you.”

He led her to a hidden door behind a curtain. He opened it and revealed a dark staircase. He said, “Follow me.”

She followed him down the stairs, feeling confused and scared. She didn’t know what was going on, but she felt a strange connection to him. She felt like she knew him somehow.

They reached a basement room that was filled with paintings and sketches. He turned on a light and pointed to a large canvas on an easel.

He said, “This is my premier painting. The one I’ve been working on for years. The one that no one has ever seen.”

She looked at the painting and gasped. It was a portrait of her and him, holding hands and smiling. They looked happy and in love.

He said, “This is us. This is our story.”

She said, “But how? How is this possible?”

He said, “It’s possible because we are soulmates. We are destined to be together. We have been reincarnated many times, in different places and times, but we always find each other.”

He said, “You are my muse. You are my inspiration. You are my love.”

He moved closer to her and kissed her softly on the lips.

She felt a surge of emotion and kissed him back.

They embraced each other and forgot about everything else.

They didn’t notice that the painting on the easel started to glow.

They didn’t notice that they started to fade away.

They didn’t notice that they became part of the painting.

They didn’t notice that they were gone.`,

'effectiveness (noun)':
`The Test

Anna was nervous as she entered the classroom. She had studied hard for the math test, but she still felt unsure of herself. She hoped that her teacher, Mr. Lee, would be lenient with the grading.

She took her seat and waited for the test papers to be distributed. She glanced at the clock and saw that it was 9:00 am. The test would last for an hour.

She looked around and saw that some of her classmates were also anxious, while others seemed confident and relaxed. She wondered how they could be so calm.

She tried to calm herself by taking deep breaths and repeating positive affirmations in her mind. She told herself that she had prepared well and that she could do this.

She received her test paper and read the instructions carefully. There were 20 questions, each worth 5 points. She had to show her work for each question and write the final answer in a box.

She started with the first question, which was a simple addition problem. She wrote down the answer quickly and moved on to the next one.

She felt a surge of confidence as she solved the first few questions without much difficulty. They were all topics that she had reviewed and practiced.

She smiled and thought that maybe this test wouldn’t be so bad after all.

She continued with the test, but soon encountered a problem that she didn’t know how to solve. It involved fractions and decimals, which were her weak points.

She stared at the question, trying to remember the steps and rules that Mr. Lee had taught them. She felt a pang of panic as she realized that she had forgotten them.

She skipped the question and moved on to the next one, hoping that it would be easier.

But it wasn’t. It was another fraction problem, followed by another one, and another one.

She felt her confidence slipping away as she realized that most of the questions on the test were about fractions and decimals.

She felt tears welling up in her eyes as she realized that she had studied the wrong topics.

She had focused on the topics that she was good at, instead of the ones that she needed to improve on.

She had mistaken efficiency for effectiveness.

She had wasted her time and energy on studying what was easy, instead of what was important.

She had failed to prepare for the test properly.

She looked at the clock and saw that it was 9:45 am. She only had 15 minutes left to finish the test.

She felt hopeless and defeated. She knew that she wouldn’t be able to pass the test.

She wished that she could go back in time and study differently.

But it was too late.

She put down her pencil and buried her face in her hands.

She sobbed quietly as she waited for the time to be up.`,

'beneath (preposition)':
`Beneath

She had always been afraid of what lurked beneath the surface of the water. Ever since she was a child, she had nightmares of dark shapes and sharp teeth waiting for her in the depths. She avoided swimming pools, lakes, and oceans, preferring to stay on dry land where she felt safe.

But today was different. Today was her birthday, and her friends had surprised her with a trip to the beach. They had rented a boat and planned to go snorkeling in the coral reef. They said it was the most beautiful thing they had ever seen, and they wanted to share it with her.

She tried to act excited, but inside she was terrified. She didn't want to disappoint them, but she also didn't want to face her fear. She hoped they would forget about the snorkeling and just enjoy the sun and the breeze.

But they didn't forget. They brought masks, fins, and tubes, and handed them to her with smiles. They told her how easy it was, how fun it was, how amazing it was. They said they would be with her all the time, and nothing bad would happen.

She wanted to believe them, but she couldn't. She felt a knot in her stomach as they put on their gear and jumped into the water. She watched them from the boat, splashing and laughing and pointing at things she couldn't see.

She knew she had to join them. She knew they were waiting for her. She knew they meant well. But she also knew she was scared.

She took a deep breath and put on the mask. She looked at the water and saw nothing but blue. She wondered what was beneath.

She put on the fins and grabbed the tube. She hesitated for a moment, then plunged into the water.

She felt a shock of cold and a rush of bubbles. She opened her eyes and saw a world of color and life.

She saw fish of all shapes and sizes, swimming in schools or alone. She saw corals of all hues, waving in the current or standing still. She saw starfish, sea urchins, sea turtles, and more.

She felt a touch on her shoulder and turned around. She saw her friend smiling at her through the mask. He pointed at something behind her.

She turned again and gasped. She saw a dolphin, gliding gracefully through the water. It looked at her with curiosity and intelligence. It came closer and nudged her gently.

She felt a surge of joy and wonder. She reached out and touched its skin. It felt smooth and warm.

She smiled and followed it as it swam away. She forgot about her fear. She forgot about everything else.

She only saw what was beneath.`,

'worthwhile (adjective)':
`The Gift

She had always wanted to see the ocean. Ever since she was a little girl, she had dreamed of the blue waves, the white sand, the salty breeze. She had read books and watched movies about the sea, but she had never experienced it for herself. She lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere, far away from any coast.

She had saved up for years to afford a trip to the beach, but something always came up. A broken car, a medical bill, a family emergency. She had to postpone her plans over and over again, until she almost gave up hope. She was getting older, and her health was declining. She wondered if she would ever see the ocean before she died.

Then, on her birthday, she received a surprise gift from her son. He had booked a flight and a hotel for her, and he was taking her to the beach for a week. He said he wanted to make her happy, and he knew how much this meant to her. He hugged her and told her he loved her.

She couldn’t believe it. She was finally going to see the ocean. She packed her bags and boarded the plane with her son. She felt nervous and excited at the same time. She couldn’t wait to see the water.

When they arrived at the hotel, she ran to the balcony and looked out. There it was. The ocean. It was more beautiful than she had imagined. It sparkled under the sun, and it stretched as far as she could see. She heard the sound of the waves crashing on the shore, and she smelled the salt in the air. She felt tears in her eyes.

She turned to her son and thanked him. He smiled and said it was his pleasure. He said he wanted to make her dream come true. He said it was worthwhile.

They spent the week together, enjoying the beach. They swam in the water, built sandcastles, collected shells, watched sunsets. They laughed and talked and made memories. They were happy.

She felt like she had lived more in that week than in her whole life. She felt like she had fulfilled her purpose. She felt like she had seen heaven.

She died peacefully in her sleep on the last night of their trip.

Her son found her in the morning, with a smile on her face.

He knew she was happy.

He knew it was worthwhile.`,

'intake (noun)':
`The Intake

She had been waiting for this day for months. The day she would finally join the elite team of astronauts who would explore the farthest reaches of space. She had passed all the tests, physical and mental, and now she was ready for the final step: the intake.

The intake was a procedure that involved injecting a special serum into her bloodstream. The serum would enhance her abilities, making her stronger, faster, smarter, and more adaptable to the harsh conditions of space. It would also link her mind with the other members of the team, creating a bond that would allow them to communicate telepathically and work as one.

She entered the intake room, where a doctor and a nurse were waiting for her. They smiled and greeted her warmly, congratulating her on her achievement. They asked her to lie down on a bed and hooked her up to a machine that monitored her vital signs. Then they prepared the syringe that contained the serum.

“Are you ready?” the doctor asked.

She nodded, feeling a surge of excitement and nervousness. She had heard stories about the intake, how it could be painful, how it could change your personality, how it could make you see things that weren’t there. But she was willing to take the risk. She wanted to be part of something bigger than herself. She wanted to explore the unknown.

The doctor injected the serum into her arm. She felt a cold sensation spreading through her veins, followed by a warm tingling. She closed her eyes and waited for the effects to kick in.

She didn’t have to wait long.

She felt a jolt of electricity running through her body, making her muscles twitch and spasm. She gasped and opened her eyes, seeing flashes of light and colors. She heard voices in her head, whispering and shouting, some familiar, some not. She felt emotions that weren’t hers, joy, fear, anger, love. She felt a connection with something beyond herself, something vast and powerful.

She realized she was experiencing the minds of the other astronauts who had gone through the intake before her. She was joining their collective consciousness, becoming one of them.

She tried to focus on her own thoughts, but they were drowned out by the others. She felt overwhelmed and confused. She wanted to scream, but she couldn’t make a sound.

She wondered if this was normal, if this was what everyone felt during the intake. She wondered if it would ever stop.

She wondered if she had made a mistake.`,

'conscience (noun)':
`The Guilty Party

He knew he had done something wrong. He could feel it in his bones, in his stomach, in his conscience. He had lied to his best friend, betrayed his trust, and ruined their friendship. All for what? A few minutes of fame, a bit of money, a cheap thrill?

He wished he could take it back, but it was too late. His friend had found out the truth, and he was furious. He had called him names, cursed him out, and cut him off. He had lost his only true friend in the world, and he hated himself for it.

He tried to forget, to move on, to pretend it didn’t matter. He told himself he didn’t need anyone, that he was better off alone, that he had done the right thing. But he knew he was lying to himself. He knew he was miserable, lonely, and guilty.

He couldn’t sleep at night, he couldn’t eat during the day, he couldn’t focus on anything. He was haunted by his friend’s face, his voice, his words. He was tormented by his own conscience, his own remorse, his own shame.

He wanted to apologize, to beg for forgiveness, to make amends. But he was too afraid, too proud, too stubborn. He thought his friend would never forgive him, would never speak to him again, would never want him back. He thought he had burned the bridge beyond repair.

But one day, he gathered his courage and picked up the phone. He dialed his friend’s number and waited for him to answer. He rehearsed what he would say in his mind, how he would explain himself, how he would ask for another chance.

He heard a voice on the other end of the line. It was not his friend’s voice. It was a stranger’s voice. A cold voice. A voice that said:

“I’m sorry, but you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.”

He felt a surge of panic, of regret, of despair. He realized he had missed his opportunity, lost his chance, wasted his time.

He hung up the phone and cried.`,

'reproduction (noun)':
`The Clone

She had always wanted a child, but nature had denied her that privilege. She had tried everything: fertility treatments, adoption agencies, surrogacy. Nothing worked. She was desperate and lonely.

Then she heard about a new company that offered a revolutionary service: cloning. They could create a genetic copy of anyone, using a sample of their DNA. They claimed it was safe, legal, and ethical. They said it was the ultimate form of reproduction.

She was intrigued. She had always wondered what it would be like to have a mini-me, someone who looked like her, acted like her, thought like her. She decided to give it a try. She sent them a strand of her hair and paid a hefty fee.

A few months later, they delivered her clone to her doorstep. She was ecstatic. She opened the box and saw a baby girl, sleeping peacefully. She looked exactly like her. She picked her up and hugged her tightly. She felt a surge of love and joy.

She named her Anna, after herself. She raised her as her own daughter, giving her all the care and attention she had always dreamed of. She taught her everything she knew, shared her hobbies and interests, bought her matching outfits and accessories. She was proud of her clone.

But as Anna grew older, she started to notice something strange. Anna was not like her at all. She had different tastes, different opinions, different goals. She rebelled against her mother’s expectations and demands. She wanted to be her own person, not a carbon copy.

She realized that cloning was not reproduction. It was duplication. It did not create a new life, but a replica of an existing one. It did not guarantee similarity, but diversity. It did not produce happiness, but conflict.

She regretted her decision. She wished she had accepted her fate and moved on with her life. She wished she had loved Anna for who she was, not who she wanted her to be.

She wished she had never cloned herself.`,
